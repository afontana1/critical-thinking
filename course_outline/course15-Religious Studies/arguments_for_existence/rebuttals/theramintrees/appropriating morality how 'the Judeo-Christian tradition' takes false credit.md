title: "appropriating morality how 'the Judeo-Christian tradition' takes false credit"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
How do we formulate our moral values? Do we just copy those around us? Do we judge our actions to be okay if we see other people doing them? Do we continue to behave exactly how we were trained to behave as children? Do we allow our values to be decided for us by an external authority? parents, peer groups, professors politicians, priests, prophets? Do we question the values we encounter and construct our own values based on critical assessments? Many members of religious ideologies give credit to their religion for their moral values. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But some go further and take credit on behalf of their religion for the moral values of non-members. It’s been claimed time and time again — and it’s still being claimed — that people who live their lives without any belief in gods, religion or the supernatural have nonetheless had their morals shaped by the dominant religions of their geographical region. It’s a predictable claim. Many religious individuals regard their religion as the fundamental or even exclusive source of human morality. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For them, if non-believers appear to lead decent, moral lives it must be down to the pervasive influence of their religion. In the West, it’s claimed that secular morals have been shaped by something referred to as ‘the Judeo-Christian tradition’ — a hybrid of Judaism and Christianity. So, should we allow the credit for our core moral values to be appropriated in this way? When people claim that secular values borrow from the Judeo-Christian tradition what’s striking is their decision to ignore all history 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
before the emergence of Judaism and Christianity. Modern human beings had been in existence for over 100,000 years by the time Judaism — a much older religion than Christianity — was in its infancy. Are we expected to accept that until the advent of Judaism human beings had developed no sense of how to treat each other to co-exist as social creatures? Did the values of these religions somehow spring ready-made from a moral vacuum with no reference to the values of the local cultures of the time? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Of course they didn’t. Both religions borrowed from pre-existing social conventions and principles. It’s understandable that those who argue for the primacy of Judeo-Christian values would want to stop the historical search for moral values at their own religion but there’s no valid justification for doing so. Certain principles of moral conduct tend to emerge naturally in social groups purely because they help to preserve the group — for example, the basic principle ‘don’t kill’. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
A culture that adopts the principle: ‘kill as many people as you can indiscriminately’ isn’t going to survive long. When a religion comes along and lays down laws reflecting social conventions and principles already in existence across humanity like not stealing and not murdering that religion doesn’t suddenly own the intellectual rights to those principles. Religion is not the innovator here, just an imitator. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Animal studies show that non-human social species demonstrate empathy, compassion and an awareness of fairness which are significant ingredients in morality. Primatologist Frans de Waal and his colleagues found that when given the choice to swap different kinds of token for different food rewards chimpanzees and capuchins frequently swapped ‘prosocial’ tokens which rewarded both themselves and a partner of their species rather than ‘selfish’ tokens which rewarded them alone. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Capuchins have been observed to reward partners for cooperation in a task to gain food even when they have the choice to keep all of it for themselves. They’ve also been observed to protest aggressively when they see a fellow capuchin receiving a better reward for performing the same task. After fights, chimpanzees display distinctive reconciliation behaviour stretching out a hand to an enemy, kissing, embracing and grooming. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Basic equitable behaviour demonstrating a keen sense of fairness has been observed in a range of social species. To suggest religion is the source of this equitable behaviour is plainly absurd. And it’s no less absurd to suggest it’s the source of human equitable behaviour. What exactly is ‘the Judeo-Christian tradition’ supposed to mean? Judaism and Christianity show significant overlap in their construction holding many of the same ancient texts as sacred. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The Jewish Tanakh contains 24 books that appear in the Christian ‘Old Testament’. But even though these two branches of religion share many ancient texts there are significant differences in their translations interpretations, perspectives and foundational values. Many Jews and Christians strongly object to being lumped together. Writing in the 1970s, Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits commented: ‘As to dialogue in the purely theological sense’ ‘nothing could be more fruitless or pointless.’ ‘Judaism is Judaism because it rejects Christianity’ 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
‘and Christianity is Christianity because it rejects Judaism.’ ‘What is usually referred to as the Judeo-Christian tradition‘ ’exists only in Christian or secularist fantasy.’ The Tanakh contains instructions that are explicitly rejected by the figure of Jesus, the Christian messiah and Christianity is repeatedly presented as a reformation of older Jewish ideas. For example, in the Jewish Torah the book of Vayikra chapter 24, verses 19-20 states: ‘And a man who inflicts an injury upon his fellow man’ 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
‘just as he did, so shall be done to him’ ‘fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth.’ The Christian equivalent in the Old testament book of Leviticus reiterates this. This is an explicit instruction to reciprocate injury. And yet in Matthew 5:43, Jesus explicitly contradicts this law saying ‘You’ve heard that it was said’ ‘ “Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.” But I tell you….’ ‘If anyone slaps you on the right cheek’ ‘turn to them the other cheek.’ This verse from the Christian New Testament 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
contradicts the Jewish Torah and its own Old Testament. In the New Testament, Jesus defends and forgives those identified as adulterers and prostitutes and admonishes those who judge them. In the Tanakh and the Old Testament adulterers and prostitutes are condemned to death by fire. Time after time, fundamentally incompatible principles are promoted. So from the outset, any attempt to package Judaism and Christianity as some coalition of faith creates an unworkable hybrid, full of moral contradictions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But it’s worse than that. As well as basic conflicts of value between Jewish and Christian scripture substantially conflicting values are found in countless areas between the subdenominations of each religion. Some Christians believe that accepting the biblical figure of Jesus as their saviour will allow them to enter a post-death paradise called ‘heaven’. Other Christians believe that who will and won’t enter heaven has been decided before birth and that nothing a person does during their life can change that. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Some Christians are strongly separatist distancing themselves from those outside their group who they label with words like ‘worldly’. Other Christians promote inclusivity and interfaith dialogue. Some Jews insist the Torah is the word of their deity. Other Jews see the Torah as a collection of fallible human writings which changes their relationship to its instructions. There are also conflicts about rituals. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Some Jews believe women and men should be able to publicly recite a mourning prayer called the kaddish. Others believe it should be reserved for men. These individual denominations promote incompatible principles so to claim they represent a unified moral tradition is untenable. Even if we ignore the conflicting values of Judaism and Christianity and focus on their common ground, we find problems. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
When we look at the texts both religions regard as sacred they contain instructions to put a long list of people to death. Of course, even the denominations that insist their scripture embodies eternal, unchanging moral values don’t carry out these instructions which shows a clear disconnect between the moral values in the text and what Jews and Christians actually do. Of course, when a holy book tells us to kill blasphemers, unruly children, non-believers adulterers and same-sex lovers better to be a hypocrite and not carry out 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
these barbaric instructions than commit these killings just to be morally consistent with an immoral book. But, isn’t it best, when your own moral sense tells you an instruction is wrong to reject the authority of the instruction? When a supposedly holy book tells you to carry out executions you know to be immoral isn’t the clearest solution to recognise that the book isn’t holy at all? And that its values have no place in any civilised morality? There’s a fundamental split between scriptural values 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
and modern moral values regarding the importance of deeds. With few notable exceptions — for example, where illness or coercion is involved — we judge people as accountable for their actions and expect them to accept personal responsibility. Christianity, in contrast, discards this core value substituting the acceptance of Jesus as the sole consideration. On the surface, the Bible contains lots of instructions about how to behave, but ultimately deeds don’t count in Christianity. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
A lifetime of bad deeds is obliterated by accepting Jesus. A lifetime of good deeds is obliterated by failure to accept him. Another fundamental split is seen in the contrast between commandment-based religious moral instruction which provides no rational other than divine authority and commonly forbids challenge and criticism and secular morality, constructed through a process of independent reasoning involving ongoing critical discussion and education. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
These differences aren’t trivial. They have profound consequences for our whole relationship with morality. If we’re asked why a specific behaviour is morally wrong and all we can say is ‘Because a god says so’ or ‘Because my holy book says so’ or ‘Because that’s what I’ve been brought up to believe’ we haven’t provided a moral answer at all. We’ve just accepted what we’ve been told to think by others. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If we’re doing as we’re told with no intervening reflection, copying the crowd or simply acting out of fear of punishment or hope of reward we’re not exercising our individual moral agency. Alan claims behaviour X is morally wrong but argues from religious authority or tradition to justify his position. Ben claims behaviour X is morally wrong but justifies his position with valid reasoning. They might share the same view about the behaviour but Ben’s moral outlook owes no debt of recognition to Alan’s religion. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The fact that religions promote values doesn’t mean those values are supported by valid reasoning. In fact it’s through the careful application of valid reasoning that we continue to expose many historically celebrated religious values as immoral. Among a wealth of reprehensible stories in the Jewish and Christian scriptures are its depictions of atrocities towards children. In the Old Testament’s book of Numbers and its equivalent in the Tanakh, Bamidbar we find the prophet Moses giving instructions 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
to kill every male child of the Midianites and preserve any virgin female children as sexual stock. This from the prophet famed for delivering the Decalogue —&nbsp;ten purportedly divine commandments governing conduct, thought and worship. Lyrics to the Melodians’ song ‘Rivers of Babylon’ — later popularised by Boney M — were lifted from Psalm 137 of the Bible. The song focuses on the parts of the Psalm that express feelings of victimhood recounting how the Jews were carried away in captivity by the Babylonians and told to sing songs. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
‘Rivers of Babylon’ might not have been such a hit if it had included verse 9 of the Psalm which delights in a peculiar form of revenge against the Babylonians. It states: ‘Happy is the one who seizes your infants’ ‘and dashes them against the rocks.’ Some apologists have claimed that the word ’infants’ doesn’t refer to literal infants. It’s just being used like the phrase ‘children of Israel’ to refer to the people of Babylon. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But Isaiah 13:16 echoes the passage in Psalms and clearly refers literally to children. Writing in the 1700s, in his Exposition of the Entire Bible Baptist John Gill commented that: ‘though it may seem a piece of cruelty’ it was ‘but a just retaliation.’ He claimed it was not ‘desired from a spirit of revenge’ ‘but for the glory of divine justice’. The glorification of infanticide is not a value that shapes our morals today. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Jewish and Christian bibles contain a vast range of messages from stories of great compassion and tenderness to salivating accounts of the most debased brutality. We have the fluff and we have the snuff. But even some of the fluffy stuff isn’t quite so fluffy on closer inspection. As a former Christian, I was taught to see Jesus as the embodiment of love. But the fact is Jesus was no respecter of loving relationships that didn’t include him jealously declaring: ‘Anyone who loves their father or mother’ 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
‘more than me is not worthy of me;’ ‘anyone who loves their son or daughter’ ’more than me is not worthy of me.’ This ‘love on demand’ approach also featured in Jesus’s command to ‘love our enemies’ as well as countless commands to love Yahweh employing inducements and threats to achieve compliance. The notion of ordering people to love denies the autonomous nature of love. Who today would accept being told who they should love? Talking of relationships, the term codependency refers to relationships in which one partner 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
depends on the other as an external source of self-worth, approval and identity instead of being able to nurture those qualities within themselves. Codependency is recognised as a highly dysfunctional relationship model. But it’s the ultimate relationship model in Jewish and Christian scripture where it becomes theodependency. Here, again, instead of being inwardly cultivated self-worth, approval and identity are sought from an external source —&nbsp;this time, a god — leaving many followers vulnerable 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
to all kinds of abuse and manipulation. The doctrine of eternal punishment promoted by Christianity is deeply immoral representing the most extreme possible disproportion between transgression and penalty. By ruling out redemption or rehabilitation, it constitutes nothing more than everlasting gratuitous sadism. The foundational Christian doctrine of vicarious redemption proposes that the sacrifice of a supposedly innocent individual can atone for the sins of others. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Secular thinkers have denounced this concept as a striking perversion of moral responsibility. Born in the 1700s, Thomas Paine, one of the founding fathers of the United States, commented: ‘If I owe a person money, and cannot pay him’ ‘and he threatens to put me in prison‘ ’another person can take the debt upon himself, and pay it for me.’ ‘But if I have committed a crime’ ‘every circumstance of the case is changed.’ ‘Moral justice cannot take the innocent for the guilty’ ‘even if the innocent would offer itself.’ 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
‘To suppose justice to do this’ ‘is to destroy the principle of its existence’ ‘which is the thing itself.’ ‘It is then no longer justice.’ ‘It is indiscriminate revenge.’ In his book, God Created Humanism: The Christian Basis of Secular Values Theo Hobson seeks to give Christianity credit for modern moral thinking. He argues: ‘Secular humanism very gradually emerged within Christian culture.’ ‘Which means that the modern humanist principles’ ‘of liberty and equality are rooted in Christianity.’ 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If self-worth very gradually emerges from within an abusive family is that self-worth rooted in abuse? If science very gradually emerges within a culture that rejects science for superstition is science rooted in superstition? Sometimes values emerge as an attempt to shake humans free of the surrounding culture’s retrograde influence. And they emerge despite the best efforts of the surrounding culture to stifle and suppress them. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Hobson states, ‘…. in the mid twentieth century’ ‘the ideal of universal human rights was launched‘ ’by mostly Christian thinkers and statesmen.’ A chain of coffee-shops could be launched by mostly Christian thinkers. Doesn’t mean the coffee has Christian roots. Christians do all kinds of things  —&nbsp;good, bad and indifferent — that have nothing to do with their religion. It’s not enough to say that something was done by Christians. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In order to give Christianity the credit you have to demonstrate a sound ideological pathway to Christianity itself. And when we look for that pathway we find the problem mentioned before: the pathway repeatedly splits into conflicting directions. This helps to explain why, historically we’ve often seen Christians on both sides of a dispute. In the mid-nineteenth century on the issue of slavery in the United States there were Christian abolitionists and Christian advocates A religion proclaimed as the source of universal human rights 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
should unambiguously condemn the owning of people as property. But it doesn’t. Instead, Christian —&nbsp;and Jewish — scripture explicitly endorses it and even proposes a set of laws to regulate it. A religion that stands for everything stands for nothing. Hobson writes: ‘Christianity gave rise to a moral universalism’ ‘that is in a sense more advanced than it’ ‘for secular moral universalism is capable of being more universalist’ ‘in that it overlooks religious difference in asserting fundamental human unity.’ 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Hobson tries to give the credit for the emergence of secular morality to Christianity while admitting that secular morality in overlooking religious differences demonstrates a more advanced moral perspective than Christianity whose doctrines repeatedly exclude and condemn those who sincerely see no valid reason or evidence for supernatural belief. Credit for secular moral advances goes to secular thinkers not to Christianity. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The word ‘secular’ is often mistakenly defined as atheistic. But secular thinkers can be religious or non-religious. Secular thinking just means the person isn’t bringing religious faith into the matter. Which is why, in those cases credit goes to the thinker and not to any faith. He goes on to say, ‘Christianity should affirm secular humanism’ ‘as a public ideology but also say that it is inadequate’ ‘it is limited to the practical public sphere, the surface of life’ ‘it has no strong account of life’s meaning and purpose’ 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
‘but gravitates to an evasive shrug.’ Secular humanism doesn’t have to account for life’s ‘meaning’ or ‘purpose’. Many secular thinkers don’t agree that life has any intrinsic meaning or purpose so not providing an account of these doesn’t represent a deficiency or an evasion, but a disagreement. If Hobson wishes to make the claim that life has meaning or purpose it’s his burden to provide valid support for his claim. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If he can’t shoulder that burden then it’s his position that amounts to an evasive shrug. Hobson states, ‘Humanitarian ideals are not natural’ ‘nor are they rationally deducible’ ‘they are complex cultural traditions, brewed over centuries.’ ‘And the main ingredient in this brewing was the story of God’ ‘taking the side, even taking the form, of the powerless victim….’ Humanitarianism is about the promotion of human welfare and humanitarian ideals can be a mix of tutored and natural. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
As previously noted, we can see the basic elements of empathy and equity in the prosocial behaviour of animals and we have no reason to believe that humans alone require these same elements to be inserted magically into them by supernatural means. Of course ideals do sometimes require some teaching often to overcome cultural traditions brewed over centuries&nbsp;— traditions that’ve condemned, subjugated and executed unfathomable numbers of people based on ignorance, superstition and the bogus moral pronouncements of religious scripture 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
like the Jewish and Christian bibles, which set death penalties for a huge range of harmless activities including picking up sticks on the wrong day of the week. Part of the reason many harmless activities were able to be condemned was because of the dubious religious term ‘sin’ which has no accurate secular equivalent. With sin, we see the invention of a nebulous category that can encompass any behaviour or thought on the grounds that it represents a transgression against some god or gods without having to offer any evidence of harm. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It’s when we apply rational deduction — rather than dogmatic moral pronouncements — that we’re able to bypass all this superstitious savagery and see these harmless activities for what they are. As a former Christian, for years, I mistook Jesus for a victim. I became lost in the drama and emotion of the crucifixion story and overwhelmed by the painful sense of guilt that was handed to me by my indoctrinators who told me Jesus was crucified for me. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
When I later tunnelled my way out of my indoctrination I realised the character of Jesus wasn’t a victim at all. If Jesus was Yahweh in human form then Yahweh freely chose to undergo crucifixion according to his own premeditated plan. He had the power to do whatever he wanted. There was no coercion or necessity. In contrast, genuine victims don’t have choice or power over their situations. Being an entirely voluntary exercise the crucifixion story amounts to nothing more than a divine flirtation with sadomasochism. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
To characterise Jesus as a victim is a gross insult to genuine victims. The claim that people who live their lives without any belief in gods, religion or the supernatural have had their morals shaped by ‘Judeo-Christian’ traditions or values can be dismantled on many grounds. The very notion of Judeo-Christian traditions and values is beset with problems. Not only do many Jews and Christians strongly reject the awkward merging of their ideologies their values and the values of the individual denominations 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
of their religions show significant conflict and incompatibility. Individual cases of resemblance to secular values don’t imply that secular values have borrowed from religion ones. Secular values can be derived independently without reference to any religious scripture. Animal studies demonstrating basic empathy fairness, compassion and reconciliation also negate the idea that religions are the source of our values as does the existence of similar equitable principles in independent human cultures around the globe. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Secular moral values can develop through critical discussion allowing course correction when mistakes are discovered. Moral judgement relies on an accurate assessment of relevant information. So the very principle of adapting in the light of new information rather than sticking dogmatically to misguided ideas is an important value in itself. In contrast, religious values presented as eternal, unchanging, perfect….  can admit no mistakes forcing adherents to invent contorted apologetics to try and excuse the inexcusable. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Historically, Judaism and Christianity have both promoted and implemented scriptural values most of us find abhorrent today. Secular thinking has provided moral insights and exposed the harm in the values of those religions prompting followers to reevaluate their moral stances on a range of issues and opening the way for all of us to advance beyond exclusive religious moral systems and continue to develop inclusive human values that are relevant and coherent. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Secular thinkers have not borrowed moral capital from the incoherent hybrid that is Judeo-Christianity. We don’t owe Judeo-Christianity a moral debt and we shouldn’t put up with any attempts  on its behalf at appropriating morality. 
</p>
