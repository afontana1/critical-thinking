<p>
Transactional analysis. Part 2: games. In the first video, I looked at ego states—analogies for different styles of thinking, feeling, and behaving. I touched on controlling, nurturing, adapting and free styles, which are called in TA as Parent and Child, and compared them with Adult. Next, I will delve a little deeper into the range of these styles. I also looked at complementary transactions, where styles of thinking and behavior between two people meet to create a stable interaction. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And overlapping transactions, where similar styles conflict, producing unstable interactions. In this video I will look at games and so-called “hidden” transactions. But first, a little more about ego states. The spectrum of behavior of the child and parent is huge. Let's take the state of the Parent. At first glance, controlling may look negative and caring may look positive, but let's take a closer look. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Control may include some negative features, for example, authority, despotism, meticulousness, neglect. But it can also lead to positive experiences where discipline and guidance are needed. Criticism can be given in a constructive and tactful manner. Careness can look positive when it is expressed in support, empathy and help. But it can also be suffocating, confining, overprotective, and ultimately more negative than real caring. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It's the same with the Child's adaptable and free-flowing style. In free mode, we can be self -centered and selfish, wild and impulsive. But we can also be creative, playful, curious. The adaptive mode includes how we change ourselves in response to the rules prescribed by authorities. From the negative side, we can learn to be humble, intimidated, anxious, helpless. Or we can adapt differently, by going against the rules, becoming rebellious and anti-conformist. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
From the positive side, adaptation can help us get along with other people, accepting reasonable social agreements. Of course, there are degrees to all of these factors. Let's take humility. Like any listed factor, it can be in the spectrum from weak to strong. Subragency can be expressed in different ways, it can be passive, in the form of a reaction to the desire of people. Or proactive - predicting people's desires. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The range of human behavior here is very wide. And this is good news for solving problems with games. Instead of being stuck in 2-3 fixed reactions, there is a huge space for creativity and individuality. Let's consider the scenario. Person “A” says that he has some problems. Person B begins to offer solutions. One by one, a person “a” begins to reject each of them, giving reasons why no of them will work. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
“B” eventually runs out of ideas, “A” teases him: “What a helper you are!” This is a classic game, known in the one as "why not you ... - yes, but ..." In his book Games People Play, TA founder Eric Byrne looks at many of these games. Why is this a game?Because what is said does not agree with what is happening psychologically. A superficial look at their dialogue might suggest that “A” is looking for help and “B” is offering it. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But in reality, “A” doesn’t want help at all. In reality, “A” just wants attention and justification for his inaction. What happens to ego states in this case? On a social level it looks like an adult-adult, “B” offers reasonable, practical, adult recommendations, and “A” points out their reasonable, practical shortcomings. But under this layer, at the psychological level, “a” proceeds from the helpless and suffering state of the child. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And “B” reacts to this, accepting the style of a saving parent. This is what is known as a “hidden” transaction that describes the discrepancy between superficial manifestations and hidden motives. "A" ends the game by switching to the critical parent, with "B" switching to the helpless child. This change in states by the end of the game is known as a “switch”, the so -called “embarrassment” follows the switch, The moment of confusion, when the victim of the game realized that she had just been held. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Now “reckoning” comes when the initiator of the game feels right and superior, and “B” feels incompetent and stupid. Games can be played to varying degrees, with TA offering three broad levels. Games of the first degree are the softest, they feel acceptable in the player’s social group. [Soft, acceptable] Players of the second degree of games prefer to hide the fact that they play these games and not play them with people they know. [Socially unacceptable] Games of the third degree can lead to injuries, death, criminal liability. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Some suggest that there is a fourth degree playing out through politics, affecting communities, nations and the entire planet. TA assumes that all parties in games are active participants and views the initiator's target not as a helpless victim, but as an actively participating player. In accordance with this idea, it prescribes names for the actions of the relevant players. Player “A” initiates the game using a “hook”, invitations using a “hidden” transaction. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
To make the game efficiently, the player “B” must take a hook at both levels. Doing this, in terms, he gives his “clue” - a certain need, which has “B”, which “A” can operate. It could be a need for recognition, a need to appear wise or superior, or even belittled. By the way, now we have all the components for the formula of games in that.The game is defined as a combination of hook + clue, Which leads to a series of interactions or “reactions” between players, which is the main part of the game. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Then, in the end, to the “switch”, “embarrassment” and “reckoning”. Stephen Cartman created another way to conceptualize games with the help of his famous “dramatic triangle”, Applying the three dramatic roles of the victim, the pursuer and the Savior. Transforming the game “Why not you ... - Yes, but ...” In this format, we have “a”, starting as a victim, and “B” as the Savior. Switching occurs when "A" and "B" switch roles, with "A" becoming the stalker for victim "B". 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Why do we play games? Here comes the opportunity to satisfy mutual needs. The initiator through his hook, and the target through his hooks. Another reason is simply attention. If someone craves attention, then he seeks it, And in the absence of positive attention, negative attention is better than nothing. The drama provides potentially inexhaustible attention supply, as players support the conflict, switching from the pursuer to the state of the victim and vice versa. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The third idea is that games support what TA calls our “life position.” It assumes that through the influence of our environment and upbringing, we can take a wide position in our relations to other people. We can take an attitude of equality with other people, that is, an “I'm okay, you're okay” attitude. Or a depressive position, lowering oneself below others. [I'm not okay, you're okay.] An arrogant position, setting others below yourself.[I'm fine, you're out of order.] Or a doomed position, lowering everyone.[I'm wrong, you're out of order.] 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It suggests that we prefer to justify these positions for ourselves, even when they distort reality. And we choose games that confirm our basic position. How can we put all this in practice to identify games and get out of them? The moment that I first want to especially emphasize, which is applicable to the entire series of rollers: Many of us most likely came across various training videos about relationships or self -confidence, which shows someone using prescribed techniques to confront a bully or manipulative employee. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And in response, the abuser is kindly retreating, recognizing his wrong, and magically transforms into a good and accommodating person. We all know that life is not like that.People who enjoy their superior position in unequal relationships do not give it so simple. Most often they will persist or even increase their Abuez. Human persistence in games can be very different, and sometimes it is simply impossible to turn interaction into positive and fair. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Understanding this ... Here are some options that it offers to solve problems with games. Games can be over before you even realize you played them because we can become forgetful. Therefore, before the start of the game, try to reliably analyze: what is happening?How did it start? Who started this?What happens in the game?What feelings do you experience?How does it end? Awareness of these factors can alert you that you are in the game. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
See which of your needs are involved.If there is a need for approval, can you allow disapproval? If there is a need to be understood, then interacting with someone who intends not to understand you, no matter what you say, can you afford to abandon this need this time? The clues will be considered deeper in the next video. Watch for "depreciations". In TA, these are judgments that distort or deny some aspect of reality. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
"This picture is just garbage!"- This is a depreciation, a statement that the picture is objectively worthless. "I don't like this picture."- Not a depreciation.Games always include any depreciation.[I can't ... you are useless ... you are always ... you never ...] Due to the dual nature of game transactions (the presence of hidden transactions), they often cause a characteristic slippery sensation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, maybe someone is trying to appear to be your friend, but in reality they are trying to suppress you. That slippery feeling could be a warning. If you realize that you are in the game, then there are a number of possibilities. You can share your awareness of the game with another player and offer to stop it.React in an adult state. If you consider the game “Why don't you ...” - yes, but ... ”, then the parent component here manifests himself in the assumption“ b ”that he can come up with a solution that“ a ”has not yet thought about. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Let's remove this component of the parent and see what we stayed with. Here, “B” gives “A” a loan of trust that she will be able to independently find solutions.Now “A” has nothing to reject. We can react from other states than those that the game forces. This applies to those negative and positive aspects of parent and child described earlier. Here are 4 examples of alternative reactions to the game "Why don't you ... - Yes, but ..." A negative controlling parent produces a dismissive, dismissive reprimand. ["You're always complaining!"] 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The positive controlling parent questions the “devaluation” that “A” expresses that her task is impossible. And he advises her to try to start, in an encouraging manner. The negative, caring parent rushes to the rescue, and this will most likely go to the game "Why don't you ... - Yes, but ..." A positive caring parent wants to help, but offers “a” to take the initiative.Thus, the responsibility for the problem remains on “A”. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If someone intends to persist, despite reasonable response measures and clearly agreed boundaries, then the best solution can be completely cutting off this person from himself. Not much can be achieved, trying to agree with people who are stuck in a dramatic role. This video concerned some ideas about games.In the next video, I will examine the clues in detail.
