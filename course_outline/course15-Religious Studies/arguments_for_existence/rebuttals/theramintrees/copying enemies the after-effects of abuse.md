title: "copying enemies the after-effects of abuse"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
Escaping an abusive environment — an abusive relationship, family, or ideological group — can draw deeply on your well of inner resources. Your patience, your resilience, your integrity your determination, your ego. All of these can be severely tested as you disentangle yourself from an elaborate nexus of false ideas. Unfortunately, the poison can go a lot deeper than we think. As we move on with our lives, we don’t realise some of the malignancy we thought we’d gotten rid of has hitched a ride with us. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Without knowing it, we can find ourselves copying some of the destructive behaviour we thought we’d left behind. It’s understandable. In abusive environments, unhealthy behaviour gets normalised. We learn from bad examples. We also develop distorted coping strategies to deal with the abuse. Ways of shutting down and protecting ourselves. Sometimes we carry these strategies over into our new relationships not realising how destructive they are, or how they echo our abusers’ behaviour. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For many former targets of abuse the idea that they’re copying their abusers in any way is repugnant. But later I’ll be looking at how apparently opposing mindsets can sometimes produce similar destructive behaviour. Copying our enemies can have significant knock-on effects in a few distinct areas. It can affect our ability to grow as an individual. It can affect how we relate to other escapees who’ve made it out of abusive environments and how we relate to the people who remain inside abusive environments 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
including the ways we might try to open their eyes to the abuse. I want to explore all these areas. To give that exploration context I want to briefly reflect on how we get drawn into abuse and how we escape from it. Some people are born into abuse. Some submit to it in their adulthood. The goal’s the same at any age. Whether they come in the form of partners, family members or members of ideological groups abusers aim to get us to accept their distorted version of reality uncritically as the truth. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Over time, child and adult targets have their individuality progressively suppressed. Acts of independence are met with shaming or punishment so that targets come to associate individuality with guilt or fear. They’re trained not to trust their own senses and critical reasoning. They’re taught instead to seek external validation from their abusers who, in effect, become their dealers, controlling their supply of self-worth. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Abusive systems all push the same message: that a sense of worth is only valid if it’s supplied by other people and that when we try to supply our own self-worth it’s an inferior corrupted product. Eventually, targets become fully-fledged actors on their abusers’ stage sticking rigidly to the script their abusers give them. Even though they’ve been transformed almost beyond recognition remnants of their former selves remain, albeit deeply suppressed. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Even people indoctrinated as very young children can sometimes later remember that brief period in childhood when they first started thinking for themselves and when they felt no concern about asking awkward questions. They remember how silly the answers sounded and how they felt free to say so. But then the punishment kicked in hard and the laughing stopped. And their connection to that authentic individual they used to be gradually faded from view as they became immersed in their abuser’s script. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For some of us, that connection with our authentic selves eventually returns. It happens differently for each person. It could be discovering a question we can’t answer a logical contradiction, a hypocrisy, a lie. It could be seeing people mistreated with an extremity we weren’t prepared for or finding unexpected allies in people we’d previously been turned against by our abusers. And so on. Whatever it is, we realise there’s a serious problem with the version of reality we’ve been handed. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For some folks, the spell is instantly broken. For others, the process can take weeks, months, years. But it’s begun. We’ve identified that there’s a problem. Some of us will try to solve it ourselves — only to find more problems. We begin to see some of the massive distortions used to hold the abuser’s false reality together. Without realising it, we’ve kick-started our independent thinking. We’ve begun to lean on our own understanding to validate our own experience. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Part of our long-suppressed individuality is waking up. Many of us make an understandable mistake. We consult other members of the abusive system. But chances are, from their angle, the only thing that seems off is us. They’ll assume the fault is with us and explain to us how we need to approach the problem from another direction. If your problem is that your father is tearing your family apart with malicious attacks you might be told to focus on everything he’s done for you. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If your problem is that the religion you were taught to believe was all about love is full of promises of sadistic torture you might be told to trust that there must be good reasons for that torture even if you can’t understand them. If your problem is that the group you believed was fighting for equality is routinely perpetrating gross inequalities you might be told some people are more equal than others. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
By consulting our fellow members, we’re seeking answers from the wrong people. To be able to comprehend the problem we’re presenting they would have to go off-script. Chances are they can’t. It can be extremely isolating when we start going against the abuser’s script. We can forget how powerful its grip can be. When we share our concerns, we’re repeatedly met with blank faces and treated as if we’re the problem. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
As we investigate deeper darker layers of problems it can feel like we get blanked out completely as if we’re speaking another language. Although our concerns are met with silence, avoidance and denial sometimes we’ll later find out we did get through to some people who began to look around at what they’d been accepting and open their eyes. Things come into a whole new focus for them when they begin to see the problems we’re pointing out. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But seeing the truth doesn’t mean they’ll take action. For them, action might risk levels of discomfort or loss they’re not ready for. Instead, they might choose to go along with the false reality and try and find ways to minimise the problems they saw. They might tell themselves that every group has its flaws. Which is true. But not every group condones and enables abuse. Critics don’t last long in abusive environments. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The choice tends to be stark. Comply or leave. Sometimes the choice is made for us when we get formally discarded and shunned. Even though it’s an abusive situation, leaving can be tough. We sometimes have to work through lots of emotions and let go of powerful fantasies that things can be fixed; that there’s always hope for change. These are just forms of denial and bargaining. Eventually we accept that the abuse is going to continue. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
When we leave an abusive situation the ground ahead can seem patchy and shaky at the start. But gradually it begins to fill out. We begin to walk around more confidently in our new free terrain. Our life slowly begins to find some shape again. But sometimes progress suddenly seems to stop. We can find ourselves getting tangled up in old familiar patterns. Sometimes we’re dealing with what are called ‘fleas’. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The term comes from the phrase ‘When you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas’. Fleas are the maladaptive habits and traits we’ve picked up from the abusive environment and they vary from person to person. An example of a flea might be triangulation. Triangulation is a manipulative strategy used by abusers where a third party is used to play people off against each other. Targets might have their achievements negatively compared with someone else. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
An abuser might stir up conflict between two targets by falsely reporting that they’ve made nasty comments about each other. Triangulation can be a messy and destructive business. But after they’ve escaped their abusers targets sometimes find themselves using triangulation not maliciously, but because they feel powerless. Direct interactions might still arouse too much vulnerability. Indirect methods can feel safer. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Instead of dealing with relationship problems assertively they might resort to bringing in other people to defend them, muddying the waters. Instead of being direct about their attraction to someone they might resort to triangulation by using a third party to try and arouse jealousy. Even though there’s no malicious intention the triangulated party can still feel betrayed or manipulated. When targets of abuse learn to express their complaints, their needs and their desires directly the urge to triangulate will fall away. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Another flea is emotional volatility. Targets of persistent abuse have often had to suppress powerful instincts instincts to defend themselves, to fight, to escape. Many targets try to suppress their own thoughts because they’ve been taught to believe in thoughtcrime. Abusive environments are also full of unacknowledged emotions. Targets learn to suppress unacceptable feelings. Which feelings are considered unacceptable will vary from group to group but anger is commonly forbidden. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In healthy situations, emotions like anger have a volume control rising from annoyance to rage in graduated degrees. In abusive situations, because anger is squashed down it becomes more like an on-off switch. Targets’ anger can emerge in sudden destructive flashes just like they did with their abusers. Other examples of fleas include avoiding accountability hypersensitivity to criticism and trouble with boundaries. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In their abusers, these traits come from a place of entitlement. In targets, these traits arise in response to excessive punishment and being shown no healthy respect for their possessions, privacy and personal space. When targets see themselves acting like their abusers they often feel mortified and wonder if they’ve become the thing they despise. But the fact they feel mortified shows they haven’t. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Their abusers don’t feel remorse. All of these hangovers from the abusive environment can have a negative impact on future relationships and personal development. But identifying them is the first step to recovery. All of these anxious habits can be replaced with healthier responses with time, awareness and education about the after-effects of abuse. Copying enemies can become an issue in our relationships with other escapees. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In October 2012, I read a newspaper article by an ex-Scientologist called Martin Padfield. He was promoting a conference a few miles away that day called ‘The Cult in Your Backyard’. I hadn’t heard much about Scientology back then so I drove along. I learned that the Scientology organisation was a pseudoscientific high-control group one that shares a number of parallels with the religious high-control group, the Jehovah’s Witnesses. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
These include the official promotion of deceptive tactics against outsiders including secular authorities and the practice of shunning former members. I asked the panelists at the conference what initially attracted them to Scientology. Hearing their stories back to back underscored what a diverse bunch they were in their backgrounds, their experiences and their attitudes to Scientology. Some panelists were still holding onto the central belief system practicing Scientology as independent agents. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
One practicing panelist appeared to believe claims that some Scientologists had manifested abilities like rolling a pencil across a table without touching it and seeing through walls. Another panelist claimed she could leave her body at will. On the other end of the spectrum other panelists were unreservedly scathing about Scientology’s claims including the supposed powers it was said to confer like telekinesis and mastery over illness. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They viewed Scientology as intrinsically damaging and disapproved of it in all its forms — independent or corporate. What was striking was the respect all of these ex-members showed each other. Despite irreconcilable differences in their positions the panel — and the audience — were all able to express themselves without fear of censorship. There was no coercion, no silencing of opinions, no personal attacks. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
No suppressive persons. What united the panelists was their focused condemnation of abuse. It was a great example of what a mature atmosphere of free expression could be. As we all know, relationships between escapees from abusive groups aren’t always so smooth. Some people get condemned for being too soft and forgiving. Some are condemned for being too hard-line and unforgiving. But what really burns is when escapees start using the abusive tactics of their former group on each other. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
At the ‘Cult in Your Backyard’ conference, one panelist, John McGhee noted that sometimes independent Scientologists who’d broken away from the organisation still engaged in the practice of shunning, known as disconnection. To know the pain of shunning simply for disagreeing and then inflict it on others simply for disagreeing is an extremely sad example of copying the enemy. Some folks I’ve spoken with have left abusive groups that had fixed hierarchical structures dividing members into elite and subordinate subgroups. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Having hoped to find an open, egalitarian community of ex-members they’ve reported experiencing a similar hierarchical vibe from some of their fellow escapees. There’s a sense that some people have carried their former roles with them. It can feel like they’ve jumped out the frying pan into a slightly smaller frying pan. And it can spark a lot of distressing memories. Sometimes people copy their enemies in insidious ways that might seem positive at first but their coercive style is a clue that something else is going on. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Some former targets of abuse try to push other former targets to forgive their abusers. They continue to press the point, even when their advice is repeatedly declined. They argue and insist and pressurise. They insinuate that a lack of forgiveness shows some moral deficiency or that it’ll somehow backfire on the unforgiving individual. These are some of the same manipulations abusers use to extract forgiveness. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
These echoes of our abusers are depressing but understandable. When we’ve been exposed to certain behaviour for an extended period it becomes a familiar reference model. Sometimes, without thinking, we fall back on what feels familiar. While it’s understandable, it’s important to recognise these abusive practices and to do what we can to eradicate them. Every time we mindfully reject the degrading practices of our former abusive environments we flush out more of the last remnants of their poison. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Copying enemies can become an issue in our dealings with our former abusive groups. Our interactions with them can arouse a lot of emotions. To feel anger is perfectly natural. Some people are against expressing it. For me the expression of anger in itself isn’t the problem. Anger’s healthy and appropriate when it’s focused on the abuse like it was in the Scientology conference. But it becomes destructive when we begin to vent wildly and indiscriminately attacking innocent individuals who we lump together with the abusive elements. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Sometimes whole demographics are demonised. We attack the body instead of the tumour. The bullied can become bullies, in the guise of champions. Thinking of themselves as rescuers who stand for justice they drift into a persecutor position, actively perpetrating injustice. Unfocussed anger helps no one — including ourselves. Because we can plainly see the false reality that underpins our old group it can feel surreal watching members figuratively walking around on thin air making assertions with nothing to stand on. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Of course from their angle the ground beneath us can seem just as insubstantial as it once did to us. Getting to a place where both parties can hear each other can be a delicate process. It helps if we’re clear about exactly what we’re trying to achieve. Why are we doing this? To feel better about ourselves? To score points? Do we want to rip individuals out of the group at any cost? Around ten years ago, an atheist YouTuber told me he and some other atheists had held one of their theist friends captive for several hours 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
subjecting him to intense questioning and refutation over the existence of his god. He said they succeeded in de-converting his friend to atheism although his friend reported a great sense of bleakness. The YouTuber predicted I probably wouldn’t approve of their method but emphasised that it worked. He was right. I was horrified. I was horrified because it was done to me — only in reverse. There was a time in my childhood when I was backing out of the religion I’d been indoctrinated into. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But I was forced to stay against my will. Feeling powerless, I surrendered to a kind of Stockholm syndrome reaction embracing a dogmatic ideology I felt imprisoned by. I was broken. Coercive tactics like these have been turned into a career by some folks. Born in 1930, Ted Patrick became famous as a professional deprogrammer working to break the undue influence of abusive groups on individuals. Relatives of targets who’d been recruited by religious high-control groups would approach him to help rescue their loved ones. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Although Patrick’s intentions were positive his methods were extremely controversial. He’d arrange forcible abductions and hold targets against their will in a secure location. Family members were brought in to appeal to the target to come back to them. It could be an emotionally chaotic environment in which parents were free to subject their targets to threats, mockery and tearful guilt trips. Although Patrick’s interventions did produce a few success stories many of them backfired driving individuals back to their abusers 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
with their defences now sky-high. Steven Hassan, a former recruit of the Unification Church otherwise known as the Moonies has also made it his life’s work to combat the undue influence of high-control groups. Although he’s admitted to sometimes arranging to meet recruits under a slightly deceptive pretext his methods differ substantially from Patrick’s. Recruits come freely and can leave at any time. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They’re simply presented with detailed accurate information about the group they’ve become involved with and allowed to make up their own minds. If the information prods that suppressed individual awake —&nbsp;great. But even if targets go back to their abusive groups they’re not left with distressing memories of being abducted. And the accurate information they’ve been given might start to chime with their experiences in the group. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They’ve been empowered. For me, this reflects the prime goal. It’s not about making people think what we want them to think. That’s exactly what abusers do. It’s about empowering people with the tools to think for themselves. I wasn’t dragged out of the abusive groups I’ve found myself in. I walked out by myself because I’d been able to think independently. When we take independent thinking as our starting point forceful combative solutions can give way to nurturing solutions centred around the idea of personal growth. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, when we see children forced into the religion of their parents some of us might want to try and outlaw child indoctrination. But another approach is to ensure young children are educated about all religions and about the option of ticking ‘none’. That way we help to empower them with information. There’ll always be abusers and dogmatists. Rather than focus on limiting their behaviour we can limit their influence by educating and empowering our children. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
When you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas. When you leave a poisonous environment sometimes you take a little poison with you. But it doesn’t have to be a permanent feature. Every time we notice some of that poison in ourselves we get the chance to detox by choosing to grow and define ourselves on our own terms instead of copying enemies. 
</p>
</div>
<br>
