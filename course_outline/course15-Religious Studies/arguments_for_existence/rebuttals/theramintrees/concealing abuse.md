title: "concealing abuse"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
Malignant individuals and groups use various methods to try and force their targets into submission. Each method attempts to induce its own distinctive psychological deterrent. Some try to arouse shame. Others try to instil a sense of helplessness and dependence. Others are designed to create intense confusion. But the aim is always the same: to train targets to doubt their own judgement and stop them thinking for themselves. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Manipulators can then gradually impose their rules — rules they can change any time they like which the target will come to accept without question. Manipulators can also isolate the target away from the people who could help them escape. Targets are taught to despise or even fear these potential sources of support leaving them truly cut off. In healthy families, as they develop infants learn to take progressively larger steps. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They risk longer unaccompanied explorations of their world where they encounter some nice things and some not-so-nice things. Secure in the knowledge they can return to safety if they feel overwhelmed they learn to cope with the bad and enjoy the good. Their self-reliance increases and their world expands. Targets of manipulative groups experience this developmental process in reverse. They learn to take smaller steps. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They’re discouraged from engaging with the outside world which is portrayed as hostile and dangerous. They’re taught that good only exists within the group. Their self-reliance decreases and their world shrinks. Piece by piece, they surrender their autonomy and succumb to increasing supervision. When faced with dilemmas, they learn not to trust their own reasoning but to seek advice, direction and permission from the group. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They’ll be instructed to do things that arouse great anxiety and distress, even heartbreak like demonising good people and shunning loved ones who disagree with the group. They’ll be told they need to be ‘brave’ and not give in to these misguided emotions. The group is their real family. But their emotions aren’t misguided. The pain they feel is evidence of their humanity — their abiding sense of fairness, compassion and justice. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But these qualities are antagonistic to groups who seek one thing from their targets: compliance. And targets will be repeatedly forced to choose between being loyal to the group and being true to their humanity. That choice is perhaps never more stark than when a target becomes aware that a child from the group has made an allegation of sexual abuse against another member. Is the target’s first thought for the child’s welfare or the group’s image? Their answer will provide a gauge of their humanity. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
I want to look at a historical case and a current ongoing case of manipulative groups that’ve tried to conceal abuse. And I want to celebrate the genuinely brave individuals who’ve worked to expose them. In 1968, in California, Christian minister David Berg founded the group ‘Teens for Christ’. It would later become known as: ‘The Children of God’, ‘The Family’ ‘The Family of Love’ and finally its current name: ‘The Family International’. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Presented himself as fatherly prophet Berg predicted the world would end in 1993 and pressed followers into full-time evangelising to claim as many souls as possible. Children were frequently sent to restaurants and businesses to sing songs and share their faith. Followers lived in communes called colonies and life in the group was strictly regimented with rules on everything from hairstyles to drink consumption to toilet paper. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Anyone who questioned Berg’s ideas was severely reprimanded. Berg, who called himself ‘Mo’ —&nbsp;short for Moses —  was a reclusive figure. Assisted by his wife Karen Zerby who declared herself a queen and renamed herself ‘Mama Maria’ Berg communicated his ideas, his commandments his dreams and professed revelations to the group through sensationally headlined letters called ‘Mo letters’. These included frequent tirades against people in the outside world, labelled ‘Systemites’. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Most strikingly, the Mo letters were saturated with descriptions and illustrations of sex including depictions of Berg being seduced by children. History’s shown that self-styled divine prophets create gods in their own images. David Berg’s doctrines reflected his own sexual compulsions. He distilled Christian scripture down to one rule called the ‘Law of Love’. As long as it was done in love Berg claimed it kept their god’s law of love. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Berg used this doctrine to endorse sex with virtually anyone as long as it was done in love including children and relatives. He called it ‘sharing’ and only male same-sex partners were forbidden. Berg encouraged his followers to send him sexually explicit home movies. He especially enjoyed videos of erotic dancing. In one film from Family members in Greece 20 adults and children performed stripteases to the strains of Richard Clayderman and Mantovani. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Berg also used the videos to handpick child brides. Amy Bril, who escaped the group after her father’s suicide said she was transported to Berg’s secret residence and married to him at 13 following her performance in a striptease video. In the early 1970s, Berg introduced religious prostitution quaintly re-branded ‘Flirty Fishing’ —&nbsp;or ‘FFing’. He asked female members if they were willing to be nailed like the Biblical character Jesus was nailed to a cross and sent them out to seduce strangers. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In a Mo letter called ‘The 7 F’s of FFing’ he outlined the various ways these strangers — called ‘Fish’ — could serve the group. Some would simply&nbsp;fund the group with sex payments. Some would become members. Some in positions of power could even provide political backing. In 1975, after Flirty Fishing a local hotel worker in Tenerife Berg’s wife Karen Zerby gave birth to David Moses Zerby, nicknamed Davidito who Berg treated as his own son and successor. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The couple documented every aspect of the boy’s life in a book called ‘The story of Davidito’ which Berg presented as a guide to raising children. It became a record of Davidito’s sexual abuse. Photos of him in his first three years were captioned with sexual insinuations suggesting he had a ‘come hither’ look and enjoyed threesomes. A chapter called ‘My Little Fish’ showed him in multiple sexual acts with one of his nannies. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Following Berg’s doctrines and personal example abuse was widespread within the group. Verity Carter, who escaped the group at 15, described it as ‘hell on earth’. She reported being abused from the age of four by various members, including her father was who convicted. Author Natacha Tormey, who escaped at 18 also reported being abused from the age of four by a man called ‘Uncle Clay’ who persisted even when she was down with a fever. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Peter Frouman&nbsp;reported being abused at 11 by a woman of 28 in front of an approving audience that included his mother. Because sex between adults and minors had been normalised it didn’t seem like abuse. Sylvia Padilla raised seven children in the group. Aside from being pressured into sex with other members and into prostitution Sylvia eventually discovered the abuse her children suffered. Of her first four children, the two youngest, Victoria and Miriam reported being pushed to perform stripteases in their early teens. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The second oldest, Debbie, was molested between the ages of 9 and 12 by a member living at their home. On discovering the abuse, Sylvia threw him out. But when Debbie was 15, group leaders began molesting her. Debbie had been prepared to fend off ordinary members but she said rejecting leaders felt impossible. Sylvia’s oldest child, Shuly, didn’t make it out of the group alive. At 15, she contracted lupus an autoimmune disease that turns the body against itself. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Members were encouraged to shun worldly medicine but for a while Shuly accepted drug treatment. To distract herself from the pain, she liked to read books. But books were forbidden. Shuly decided to write to Berg himself to ask if it would be okay for her to read. In his public reply, Berg insinuated that the lupus was her punishment for reading. Eventually, feeling guilty and inadequate Shuly discontinued her medication. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
She died aged 17. Berg later published a dream in which he met Shuly in heaven and was seduced by her. A graphic depiction of their sexual encounter followed. Shuly’s grieving siblings were enraged. From the start, David Berg presented himself as a revolutionary here to turn the world upside-down, emulating Jesus. From this swaggering self-assessment we should expect to see an individual boldly asserting himself into the public arena fearlessly preaching his message to the masses openly challenging the authorities of his time with unwavering conviction. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But Berg was a make-believe revolutionary. He kept his doctrines secret within the safe confines of his devoted group taking great efforts to hide them from outsiders. This included multiple ‘purges’ in which the group was told to edit or destroy sexually explicit publications, like the Davidito book. Members were threatened with excommunication for non-compliance. Some letters were pre-emptively labelled ‘BAR Pub’ meaning burn after reading publication. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Group representatives denied all accusations of abuse. When questioned about the Padilla family’s allegations a group spokesman called ‘Solomon’ rejected them outright with four key denials. Denial number one: he said no one told members to ‘share’ themselves sexually. But in a Mo letter called ‘One Wife’, couples who didn’t share were accused of failing to put the larger family first. Berg warned that their god would only take the willing and abandon the rest. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Reluctant members were told they must have a demon inside them or that they didn’t love their god enough. Escapees have reported having to follow sharing schedules created by leaders to ensure everyone shared with everyone else. The fact is members were routinely told to have sex with other members and coerced if they resisted. Denial number two: ‘Solomon’ claimed ‘Flirty Fishing’ was never synonymous with sex. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
He said it could simply mean going to a bar or a park and talking to someone about Jesus. In fact, Flirty Fishing was synonymous with prostitution as illustrated by Berg’s synonyms for Flirty Fishers: ‘God’s Whores’ and ‘Hookers for Jesus’. Denial number three: ‘Solomon’ said the group hadn’t produced pornography and claimed no knowledge of any videos dedicated to Berg. In a 1995 court hearing, the group made the same denial under divine oath. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
After tapes were produced in evidence they changed their story claiming the videos were just intended to instil a positive body image in its members. But the intention was undeniably pornographic. Pornography is defined as forms of media designed to be sexually arousing. In a Mo letter called Glorify God in the Dance Berg openly stated that he used the videos as a ‘lively accompaniment’ to sex. Over 30 highly repetitive pages, he then gave detailed instructions regarding what turned him on restating ad nauseam that dancers should be naked 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
except for a see-through scarf or veil and should dance in a provocative tantalising teasing way because stolen peeks and secret looks were more exciting. Finally, we have denial number four: ‘Solomon’ said the group didn’t believe in sex between minors and adults. In 1989, Berg released an official public denial to that effect claiming sex with minors was absolutely forbidden. In the body of his statement Berg cited the much-criticised ‘My Little Fish’ chapter in the Davidito book that showed the boy’s nanny molesting him. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Berg attempted to scapegoat her, claiming the chapter reflected her own personal experience and opinions and that such intimate relationships between minors and adults had never been encouraged or condoned in the group. But Berg’s official encouragement, condonation and participation was prolific and undeniable from his repeated justifications in group publications to the child brides he molested, including his own granddaughter Merry Berg a brave and inspiring individual who endured unthinkable abuse 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
and became an outspoken critic of the group. Another branch of child molestation in the group was revealed by Anneke and Ron Schieberl who’ve helped over 50 individuals escape and acclimatise to the outside world. They reported that they quit the group when leaders told Ron they wanted him to have sex with a 12 year old to humble her arrogance. Ron refused and threatened action against anyone else who complied. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Following Berg’s public denouncement of child sex privately, the approval continued. A secret letter to the group from Karen Zerby revealed their defiant attitude. In it, she stated fondling children was not wrong and did not constitute abuse. And she anticipated a time when the group would take a stand and be truthful about the subject. Some years later, she would see her son the boy called Davidito take a stand of his own. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Going by the new name of Ricky Rodriguez he tracked down and killed one of his abusers a nanny called Angela Smith then committed suicide. For David Berg and his representatives, the lies flowed freely even under divine oath. Many high-control ideological groups teachtheir members that it’s fine to employ deception in certain circumstances. Deception can even become an official policy with its own special name. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In Berg’s group, it was called ‘deceivers yet true’. Rules were laid out about what kinds of deception were acceptable. Deceiving other Family members was strictly forbidden as was deceiving for selfish motives like avoiding punishment for wrongdoings. But non-members, who were considered to be serving the Devil were said to have no right to the truth. As is repeatedly observed in high-control groups the leadership failed to follow its own rules. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Berg had no problem lying to avoid punishment and was happy to throw other group members under the bus to evade prosecution by authorities. And in her book ‘Born into the Children of God’ Natacha Tormey revealed a twisted way in which children were trained to break the rule of always telling the truth to Family members. When she was four, some adult members came to interview the children separately asking if anyone had touched them in a bad way. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Although Natacha had been abused by a man called ‘Clay’ her instincts prompted her to lie and say no. The next morning it was revealed that the interviews had been a test of the children’s loyalty to the group. A girl called Samantha who reported being abused was then publicly forced to eat soap then wear a cardboard sign saying: ‘I am on silence restriction for telling lies. Please do not speak to me.’ The message to the children was clear: Don’t tell anyone you were abused. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The most effective way to conceal child abuse is to ensure the children never make any allegations — not even to those they’re taught to trust. When an allegation is made, other cover-up tactics are required. Cover-ups can employ a huge range of strategies, often in combination. Sometimes allegations can be buried before they become public. Accusers can be bribed and/or threatened — a method employed by the Catholic Church to cover up child molestation by its clergy. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Sometimes damning evidence can be altered or destroyed as Berg’s group tried to do. Once an allegation’s been made public, other strategies come into play including various forms of denial. The accused can simply lie and deny the allegation flat out. They can deny knowledge or recall of the offence. They can deny that the offence comes within their sphere of responsibility. Or that the offence was as serious or far-reaching as their accusers allege. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Another strategy is evasion. The accused might try to avoid being questioned —&nbsp;wriggling out of court attendance by claiming illness or bereavement or even becoming a fugitive as Berg did to elude authorities. They might falsely claim some duty of secrecy which prevents them sharing damning material. In some groups new members are given different names. This happened with Natacha Tormey’s abuser ‘Clay’ who’d been rebaptised to reflect Berg’s idea that members should be mouldable like clay on a potter’s wheel. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Blurring identities can help abusers evade justice. Some defendants choose to go on the offensive with counter-accusations. Attacking their accuser’s character and motives. Claiming their rights are being violated. Claiming unfair prejudice or persecution. Maybe the most slippery strategies are the ones involving misdirection — otherwise known as smoke and mirrors — which direct our attention to the wrong place with misleading and irrelevant information. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Angus asks Geoffrey: ‘Does your church accept corporal punishment for children?’ Geoffrey replies: ‘Our church expects parents to discipline and raise their children.’ This is misdirection, completely bypassing the central question of corporal punishment by answering an unasked question of Geoffrey’s own invention. Meaningless phrases can be used to give a parody of answering while saying nothing. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Zara asks Jag: ‘Does your group have any female leaders?’ The truth is his group doesn’t accept female leaders. To try and cover up that truth, he replies: ‘Women are crucial.’ This statement is meaningless. It doesn’t specify how women are crucial. But he hopes this deflection will sound affirmative enough to stop the awkward questions. Later, if the truth comes out, he can truthfully say he didn’t lie. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
What he can’t truthfully say is he didn’t intend to deceive. Defendants can misdirect by using misleading, unrepresentative examples. Children of God’s spokesman ‘Solomon’ did this when he downplayed Flirty Fishing as a conversation about Jesus in a park. And, like Berg did with Davidito’s nanny scapegoats can be offered up to direct attention away from the guilty. Even if the guilty party’s forced to admit to some wrongdoing the cover-up can continue. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
To get the authorities off their backs abusive groups will sometimes fake interest in reformation. They’ll promise to ‘consider the recommendations’ of official judicial panels and undertake to introduce new safeguards. But it’s just word games. There’s no intention to change —&nbsp;and the abuse will go on. A number of these tactics have been repeatedly used by senior Jehovah’s Witnesses to try and cover up hundreds of cases of child molestation within their organisation and the doctrines that’ve helped to perpetuate that abuse. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Denial is nothing new to the leaders of the separatist Christian group Jehovah’s Witnesses, whose religious symbol is a watchtower. Any religious group in the habit of predicting the end of the world inevitably become practiced at cover-up techniques when their prophecies fail —&nbsp;as they invariably do. For The Children of God, armageddon was predicted to arrive in 1993. For Jehovah’s Witnesses, numerous termination dates spanning over a century have come and gone — including the year 1975. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Like David Berg, the Jehovah’s Witness leadership —&nbsp;known as the Governing Body — produces a range of publications to convey their ideas including their magazines ‘Awake!’ and ‘The Watchtower’. Those publications heavily pushed the 1975 end-time prediction. The year was derived using Biblical chronology to calculate the date of the supposed first human Adam at 4026 B.C.E. then adding 6,000 years —&nbsp;the allotted time for humanity’s existence. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
According to the Governing Body, at the end-time only members of Jehovah’s organisation would qualify for eternal life. The rest would be annihilated. In 1969, Awake! Magazine told young people they needed to face the fact they would never grow old in the present system and never fulfil any career the world had to offer. In the previous year, the Kingdom Ministry publication urged members to get into pioneering ministry for the organisation telling them there were only about 90 months left before human existence was completed. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In 1974, the publication then applauded members who had sold their homes to devote themselves to pioneering remarking that it was a fine way to spend the short time remaining before the wicked world’s end. The armageddon prediction changed many lives. Witnesses gave up opportunities in education and business. Insurance policies were cancelled. Some put off having children. What was the leadership doing? Buying new property. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In the early part of 1975, humanity’s final year the organisation bought the fifteen-story Towers Hotel in Brooklyn. While they were encouraging and praising huge sacrifices among their flock they were expanding their real estate. When 1975 passed without incident, the Governing Body went into denial. In July 1976, they said Witnesses who’d put off or neglected things they otherwise would’ve cared for had got it wrong. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It was their own fault for thinking Bible chronology revealed a specific date. So, to excuse its own blunders, the Governing Body scapegoated all the Witnesses who’d been guided by its blunders. It also altered evidence. In the 1968 edition of its publication ‘The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life’ it quoted a prediction made in 1960 by former US Secretary of State Dean Acheson that in fifteen years time —&nbsp;ie 1975 — the world would be too dangerous to live in. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But in the revised 1981 edition the specific timeframe of fifteen years was conspicuously replaced with the word ‘soon’. In recent years, the Governing Body’s come under scrutiny for another cover-up this time regarding child sexual abuse. The hypocrisy of this cover-up is as brazen as it gets. In a barrage of articles in Awake! Magazine the Governing Body has repeatedly pointed a sanctimonious finger at the Catholic church for its institutional cover-up of child molestation by its priests noting the long-term, often permanent, damage done to the child. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
These articles cast the Governing Body as a champion of children. A 2011 article correctly reported that abuse by priests was ignored because of loyalty to the absolute authority of the Catholic church. It neglected to mention that loyalty to the Jehovah’s Witness Governing Body which exercises vastly greater control over its flock has had the same silencing effect. A 1993 article accused the Catholic church of compounding the initial sexual abuse with a second more painful psychological abuse —&nbsp;the abuse of failing to listen or take accusations seriously 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
and only protecting abusers. A 1990 article accused the Catholic Church of hushing up cases and taking no significant disciplinary action. But people in glass watchtowers really shouldn’t throw stones. As I’ll be showing, the Jehovah’s Witness organisation is also guilty on every count. The problem of child abuse isn’t exclusive to any group. But it can become entrenched in groups that put up obstacles to justice. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
One obstacle the Jehovah’s Witness Governing Body shares with the Catholic church is its preening concern for reputation. Valuing public image over the welfare of their members has led both organisations to focus their energies on hiding their shame rather than tackling the abuse. But the Jehovah’s Witness leadership has erected other special obstacles. Through a combination of maladaptive doctrines it’s created an organisation that enables molesters and exiles their prey. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
One doctrine that protects molesters is something called the ‘two witness’ rule. Based on passages from Deuteronomy and 1 Timothy the two-witness rule demands that congregational leaders called ‘elders’ have to hear the testimony of at least two witnesses to convict an abuser. Obviously the private nature of child sexual abuse renders this condition extremely improbable. In the absence of two witnesses, a confession is required from the abuser. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If no confession is made, the matter is considered to be in the hands of Jehovah. So all abusers have to do to enjoy a life of carefree child molestation is make sure they’re not seen and decline to confess. This astounding leniency in favour of the abuser isn’t always evident with other offences. ‘Shepherd the Flock of God’ —&nbsp;a judicial guidebook for elders — gives a hypothetical case in which a married man is observed to stay overnight at the house of his secretary but denies committing adultery. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Despite the fact that there are no witnesses to adultery and no confession has been obtained it’s claimed there’s strong enough circumstantial evidence of sexual impropriety to warrant judicial action and even to allow the wife to divorce and remarry which is a rare privilege among Jehovah’s Witnesses who generally equate remarriage with adultery based on Matthew 19, verse 9. So, for adults, just seeing someone go in and out of a house is enough to establish adultery. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Meanwhile, abused children need multiple witnesses or a confession. Otherwise, case closed. The Governing Body likes to project the image of an organisation beyond reproach. To maintain this illusion, congregations are instructed to shun individuals regarded as troublesome, including close relatives. This is based on a line from 1 Corinthians: ‘remove the wicked man from among yourselves’. This doctrine might seem perfect for ridding the organisation of abusers. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Instead it repeatedly works to expel the abused. There are two main paths to getting shunned. The voluntary path is disassociation. Here, the person quits the organisation making a formal declaration of departure. They’ll then be treated as if they no longer exist. The involuntary path is disfellowshipping. Here, the organisation expels and shuns individuals who are deemed unrepentantly guilty of ‘wicked deeds’. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
These include offences like theft and assault but also extend to the following: artificial insemination by donor, which is equated with adultery; celebrating Christmas or participating in interfaith activities; smoking or selling tobacco; professional boxing; failure to abstain from blood transfusions; and associating with disfellowshipped individuals. Another offence is causing divisions —&nbsp;which can be applied to anyone who challenges or criticises the Governing Body. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Disassociation and disfellowshipping both favour the molester. When their abusers’s guilt is left in Jehovah’s hands children face the prospect of risking ongoing retraumatisation by remaining in congregations that protect their abusers. Inevitably, some children will feel driven to disassociate. For the abuser, there’s no incentive to disassociate. So disassociation works in the abuser’s favour. The threat of disfellowshipping has been repeatedly used to silence allegations. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Washington resident Erica Garza initially confided to her father about her sexual abuse perpetrated by his best friend. As an elder he’d been instructed never to call the police. But when the organisation took no action Erica said she’d go to the police herself. Her elders said if she did she’d be disfellowshipped and condemned by Jehovah. Despite this, she went ahead and her abuser was charged and convicted on four counts. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Erica and her supportive family were shunned. Child safety advocates also get disfellowshipped for speaking out. Barbara Anderson was a Jehovah’s Witness for 43 years. In the 1990s, working as a researcher at the Watchtower headquarters in New York she found files containing hundreds of accusations against male and female members along with evidence that the organisation had privately settled numerous expensive abuse lawsuits. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
After discussing these facts in a 2002 ‘Dateline’ NBC news report she was disfellowshipped. She said she was later told thousands of members had left the religion following the report and that she’d been blamed for their annihilation in the coming armageddon. While abused children and their advocates are threatened with disfellowshipping merely for seeking the justice their organisation fails to provide for the shrewd abuser the threat of disfellowshipping is non-existent. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In 2002, BBC’s Panorama reported the case of Ian Cousins who confessed to elders that he’d molested one of his daughters. Their response? He was instructed to apologise, sent home with the daughter he molested and the congregation was informed that he’d been reproved for an unspecified wrongdoing. Incredibly, that was it. This is the organisation that accused the Catholic Church of taking no significant disciplinary action. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Unsurprisingly, with no consequences to constrain him Cousins continued molesting his daughter. When she moved out to escape the abuse he turned on his other daughter, Alison. Like her sister, Alison said she informed an elder of the abuse but was accused of lying even though they had access to his previous confession of abuse. Eventually she told the elders unless they did something, she’d call the police. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In the following police investigation Alison learned of her sister’s abuse and her father’s confession. The Panorama report noted: ‘When he confessed to congregation elders, Cousins got a mild rebuke.’ ‘When he confessed in court, he got five years in jail.’ In 2015, another abused individual explained how the organisation rationalises its rejection of secular authorities in abuse cases. Testifying anonymously to the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
she recounted being threatened with disfellowshipping if she called the police by an elder who quoted 1 Corinthians 6: verses 1-8 which forbids taking brothers to court. The Commission heard evidence that the organisation had kept records of 1,006 alleged abusers in Australia since 1950 —&nbsp;none of them reported to police. I’ll be exploring the Royal Commission’s investigation in a future video. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Apparently this scriptural justification doesn’t extend to all crime. In 2016, a letter to the elders regarding their ‘Kingdom Halls’ — their places of worship — stated that theft and vandalism should be promptly reported to the local authorities. It explains: ‘When property damage occurs quick action can go far in preventing further damage’. Is that sentiment any less true of damage to children? Are children less important than property? By its actions, the organisation reveals its true values. 
</p>
</div>

Jehovah’s Witness literature repeatedly plays on wolf and sheep imagery comparing non-Witnesses and ex-Witnesses to oppressive wicked wolves intent on attacking a pure and vulnerable flock. In reality, the doctrines of the Jehovah’s Witness leadership systematically protect the wolves inside the organisation while forcing the sheep out of the flock. Is it plausible that a benevolent super-intelligent divine being would create such an glaringly flawed system? Or does this ugly mess have distinctly human fingerprints all over it?

It’s disorientating enough when survivors of child abuse get shunned by an organisation that claims to champion children. But they’re hit by another curveball when the organisation’s representatives refuse to admit that it practices shunning. Whether it’s in news interviews, in door-to-door preaching or in court hearings under divine oath when the subject of shunning comes up Witnesses repeatedly go into cover-up mode. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Suddenly this strictly enforced doctrine gets misrepresented as a matter of personal choice. Some witnesses even play the prejudice card complaining that the term shunning evokes unwelcome stereotypes. The organisation’s subterfuge regarding shunning extends to its website —&nbsp;jw.org. In its FAQ article ‘Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Shun Former Members of Their Religion?’ it even dodges its own question. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The article says baptised Witnesses who’ve drifted away or no longer preach are not shunned. This is a misleading example. The organisation doesn’t classify these individuals as former members. They’re called ‘inactive’ members —&nbsp;or ‘faders’. To become former members they’d have to disassociate or get disfellowshipped. Then they would be shunned. The article claims if a man’s disfellowshipped and his wife and children are Jehovah’s Witnesses normal family affections and dealings continue. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is another misleading example. Relatives living in the same household are considered a special case in that the organisation allows a degree of association. What the article neglects to mention is that if disfellowshipped family members ever move out of the house barring necessary family business, they can be shunned like any stranger. As the organisation comments with apparent relish: if the disfellowshipped or disassociated one is a relative living outside the immediate family circle and home 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
it might be possible to have almost no contact at all with the relative. The truth is Witnesses are told to avoid all normal contact with disfellowshipped relatives — including text messages and emails — and not to look for excuses to associate with them. Witnesses who maintain unnecessary association with disfellowshipped relatives can be disfellowshipped themselves. How does an organisation that claims to represent ‘the Truth’ justify its deliberate use of deception to conceal the sexual abuse of children 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
and the doctrine of shunning to which many of those abused children are then subjected? Jehovah’s Witness literature claims ‘all lying is bad’ and quotes Biblical passages denouncing lies as detestable to Jehovah. But like David Berg, the organisation gives itself licence to deceive. Just as Berg had his ‘deceivers yet true’ doctrine the Jehovah’s Witness Governing Body has its own version called ‘theocratic war strategy’ or ‘theocratic warfare’. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Like Berg’s doctrine, it strictly forbids lying to fellow members. Like Berg’s doctrine, it denounces lying for selfish motives. And like Berg’s doctrine, it asserts that non-members are not entitled to the truth. Putting these two groups side by side highlights the perversity of these doctrines. Here we have two groups who would each accuse the other of false teaching but wouldn’t consider them entitled to know the truth. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Both groups claim their own brand of deception is fine while the other group’s is wicked. They’re mirror images each accusing the other while exonerating themselves. This is the absurdity that results from the hypocritical systems of supremacist groups who judge others on standards they themselves decline to follow. The Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses claims deception is only used to prevent harm or persecution. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But does covering up child sexual abuse qualify as preventing harm or persecution? The problem becomes clear when we bring back the Catholic Church. If the Governing Body wants to defend its cover-up on the grounds of preventing harm or persecution it has to accept the same defence from the Catholic Church over its cover-up. More to the point, if it rejects that defence from the Catholic Church it has no defence itself. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Another hypocrisy regarding the Catholics concerns the guilt trip Jehovah’s Witness elders repeatedly use to stop children reporting their abuse to the authorities. Children are told they’ll bring reproach on Jehovah’s name. But in its many criticisms regarding Catholic child abuse did the Governing Body reproach their god? No. It reproached the church, the pope, the clergy — the humans who allowed it. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Likewise, when cases of child abuse by Jehovah’s Witnesses emerge no one’s reproaching Jehovah. They’re reproaching the organisation, the Governing Body, the elders —&nbsp;the humans who allow it. Telling children they’ll bring reproach on Jehovah isn’t just emotionally abusive. It’s a lie. The organisation’s cover-up regarding shunning also fails to qualify as preventing harm or persecution. It does put the organisation in a very unattractive light. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But it’s an accurate light. The abusive nature of shunning is something the organisation itself unwittingly acknowledged in a 2013 Awake! article about the silent treatment. It noted with disapproval how some people use the silent treatment to punish or to manipulate others into compliance. It even asked readers if that was really how they want to treat people they love. That question can be thrown right back at the Governing Body in regards to shunning. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The Jehovah’s Witness organisation is a group wrestling with huge internal contradictions wanting to project a pure, morally clean image to an outside world it despises and in the process, neglecting and abusing its own members in the most callous, heartless ways. The Biblical passage Matthew 7:16, says: ‘By their fruits you will recognise them.’ The Jehovah’s Witness leadership claims that its organisation’s authenticity can be recognised by its fruits. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It asserts that any religion unable to unite its devotees cannot have the key for uniting humankind. And it claims that the fruits of peace and harmony found within its organisation is proof that it has that key. Any group that routinely expels individuals who criticise or challenge it will eventually be left with a pool of uncritical, compliant followers. That isn’t the same as ‘uniting your devotees’. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
To unite means to bring together —&nbsp;to eradicate divisions. Eradicating people, as the Jehovah’s Witness organisation does only proves its inability to unite them. Silence does not imply peace and harmony. Silence can be pregnant with anguish. For children whose desperate reports of abuse are repeatedly dismissed as lies and who are threatened with expulsion for the sin of tainting their religion’s false image of pureness there is no peace or harmony. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
David Berg and the Jehovah’s Witness leadership had opposing views on sex with children. But both groups became a sanctuary for molesters. In Berg’s case, his doctrines actively condoned abuse. In the case of the Jehovah’s Witness leadership, even though it denounces abuse its maladaptive doctrines work to perpetuate it by silencing abused individuals and their advocates and teaching smart abusers that by simply uttering an apology they can avoid all consequences and continue their molesting. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In any healthy group, dangerously flawed procedures are acknowledged and urgently corrected. But in groups that claim timeless divine authority flaws are preserved in the formaldehyde of faith. Many individuals abused in dogmatic groups like Berg’s Family and the Jehovah’s Witness organisation have been amazed at the warmth, care and support they’ve received from the outside world — a world whose inhabitants they’d been taught to demonise. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It’s an eye-opening contrast to the cold, defensive, often accusing treatment they received in their former group. By their fruits, we will recognise the true natures of groups. The genuinely benevolent ones won’t be found concealing abuse.
