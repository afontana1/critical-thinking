title: "degrading love — part two how religions distort 'love'"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is the second of a two-part response specifically for folks who approach me with promises of their god’s love, setting out my reasons for rejecting this apparent gift and explaining why all of us deserve better. In part one, I looked at how the major world religions encourage us to view completely arbitrary life events and physical sensations as evidence of divine love. And I highlighted some of the problems this false love generates. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
I also looked at the parasitic nature of god characters such as Yahweh and Allah who're presented as loving parents, but who in fact give absolutely no love to their supposed children and instead constantly demand it. In part two, I want to expose more of the layers of depravity underpinning this parody of love. The major world religions are deeply invested in the notion of free will. If we determine our own beliefs and actions, we can reasonably be held accountable for them. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
On the platform of accountability,  religions plant their concepts of sin and virtue blaming us for the former and praising us for the latter. And on this stack of building blocks rest the ultimate concepts of hell and heaven. Mess around with the notion of free will and accusations of heresy soon start to fly. Within Christianity, emerging in the mid-1600s, the Jansenists held that humans were powerless to avoid sinning because, following Adam and Eve’s fall from paradise, humans were deprived of grace. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They further argued that any humans who were subsequently offered Yahweh’s grace were powerless to resist it. This meant humans that humans couldn't be held accountable either for their sinful nature or their redemption. The Jansenists’ ideas soon aroused papal condemnation for heresy. Within Islam, two groups emerged during the Umayyad period, between the 7th and 8th centuries, that were both denounced because of their contentious views on free will. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The school of Jabariyyah viewed humans as divine puppets whose actions were determined by the Islamic god Allah and who consequently bore no responsibility. To back up their assertion, they cited surah 76 verse 30 of the Qur’an which states that Allah’s will dictates human will. In contrast, the school of Qadariyyah proposed that humans possessed a free will completely independent of the will of Allah, making humans a rival to Allah. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Senior lecturer in Islamic studies Abdur Rashid Bhat writes that .... ‘Both these groups were disapproved of by the Muslim community for their rigid, extremist and heretical stands.’ All this bitter religious dispute to preserve our freedom to determine our own life’s course. And what do the gods expect us to do with this generous gift of freedom? Submit ourselves into slavery. Islam is pretty upfront about its desire to enslave. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The word ‘Islam’ itself means submission —&nbsp;specifically submission to the will of Allah. Read scriptural and scholarly Islamic writings —&nbsp;or simply talk to a range of Muslims — and you’ll find the word ‘human’ openly and unapologetically replaced by the words ‘servant’ and ‘slave’. You’ll find similar language in the Bible. So — the gods gave us free will so that we could choose to be slaves. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Anyone spot the fundamental problem with this deal? And there’s no room for half-hearted or grudging submission. You have to really want to put on those mental shackles — to forgo your critical thinking in order to defend the master’s stories; to limit your human relationships in order to defend the master’s supremacy; to abandon your logical faculties in order to defend the master’s inconsistencies; to waive your moral reasoning in order to defend the master’s immorality; in short, to surrender your humanity in order to defend your master’s inhumanity. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And if your hunger for this degradation isn’t strong enough? You’ll be condemned to everlasting suffering in hell. So, Yahweh and Allah —&nbsp;supposedly the most loving beings to exist — created us for slavery or torture. Even the Bible states that love and fear don’t mix. 1 John 4:18 asserts ‘There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment.’ Unfortunately, Yahweh seems determined to have it both ways. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In Matthew 22, Jesus states the greatest commandment is to love Yahweh with all our heart and soul and mind. But in books such as Deuteronomy, humans are repeatedly commanded to fear Yahweh. So we have an impossible triangle. Humans are first commanded to love Yahweh; second, commanded to fear Yahweh; and third, told that love and fear don’t mix. These contradictory angles add up to one big mess. Turning to Islam, threats of hellish punishment for non-belief contravene surah 2, verse 256 of the Qur’an, which forbids compulsion in religion. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
What greater form of compulsion is there than the threat of eternal torture? Of course, with Islam, threats aren’t confined to the afterlife. It’s a modern-day disgrace that over 20 territories on this planet have official laws and policies prohibiting deconversion from Islam. Apostates are threatened variously with fines, loss of citizenship or execution. Several ex-Muslims living in these territories have shared their personal stories with me, describing the exhausting, corrosive psychological pressures 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
they’re forced to endure on a daily basis just to survive. So much for no compulsion. Of course, compulsion in religion isn’t just a problem because some passage in the Qur’an forbids it. Compulsion backfires on Islam — and Christianity — by destroying their very foundation: free will. The types of free will typically asserted by religions are already difficult enough to support on philosophical grounds as our increasing understanding of the human brain exposes increasing complexities and obstacles regarding the concept of choice. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But the use of compulsion in religion, forcing humans into submission, destroys any claim of divinely granted free will. This has a devastating knock-on effect destroying accountability, virtue and ultimately any justification for heavenly rewards. With their threats of eternal suffering the gods huff and puff and blow their own house down. Divine attacks on free will can be found in other parts of the Qur’an and Bible. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In the Qur’an surah 2, verse 7, Allah is said to have fixed a seal on the hearts and hearing of disbelievers and veiled their vision. So disbelievers are divinely prevented from becoming believers and then punished for not believing. In the Bible, we find a similarly perverse attack on free will in the book of Exodus. In chapter 3, verses 7 and 8, Yahweh tells Moses he’s seen the oppression of the children of Israel and promises to deliver them from their Egyptian masters. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In verses 19 and 20, Yahweh says he’s sure the Egyptian Pharaoh will not liberate the Israelites. So Yahweh vows to strike Egypt with wonders, after which he predicts the Pharaoh will let them go. But in Exodus 4, we find a bizarre plot twist. Yahweh tells Moses that he’s going to harden the Pharaoh’s heart, forcing the Pharaoh not to liberate the Israelites. So Yahweh promises to liberate the Israelites then deliberately prevents their liberation by taking away the Pharaoh’s free will. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We now see why in Exodus 3 Yahweh was so sure that the Pharaoh wouldn’t let the Israelites go. What this self-defeating divine intervention means is that Yahweh’s strike against Egypt, supposedly in response to the Pharaoh’s refusal, is in fact a response to Yahweh’s own actions. Given the choice, would you freely choose to be a slave? Not only do Allah and Yahweh want us to submit to slavery they threaten us to submit with promises of unimaginable punishment, and when it suits them, they’re even prepared to force submission 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
by removing our free will altogether — as Yahweh did with the Pharaoh and then punish us for the consequences. This conflicted divine behaviour demonstrates many character traits. Narcissism. Hypocrisy. Sadism. Conspicuously absent is love. Stretching back thousands of years the practice of blood sacrifice to the gods persists to this day on a huge scale. The rationale for these sacrifices varies. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The world’s largest mass animal sacrifice is performed by Muslims as part of Hajj a vast annual pilgrimage to Mecca in which hundreds of thousands of animals — including sheep, goats and cows — are slaughtered ‘in the hope of attaining closeness to Allah’, showing that ‘they are willing to give up some of their own benefits’. Within Hinduism, the Gadhimai festival has seen millions of devotees descend on Nepal every five years for the world’s second largest animal sacrifice in which — among other animals — thousands of cattle are beheaded. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Attendants hope that this torrent of blood will make their wishes come true. Aside from the granting of wishes, and displays of self-denial, another religious rationale for sacrifice is substitutionary atonement. Here, people hope to erase their sins by casting them onto a sacrificial subject who’s punished in their place. An example of scapegoat sacrifice forms the basis of Christianity. This sacrifice is cited as a demonstration of Yahweh’s profound love. But it demonstrates no such thing. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Some folks are surprised to learn that the life of the Biblical messiah Jesus not only ends but begins with blood sacrifice. When he’s born, his parents sacrifice two birds in keeping with a divine law set out in Leviticus 12. Not the stuff of school nativities. But it sets an appropriately bloody tone for what's to come. Calling himself the son of Yahweh, Jesus infuriates the Jewish authorities. He’s arrested and tried by the Sanhedrin — a Jewish judicial assembly and condemned to death by crucifixion. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Although he foresees all of these events long in advance, he allows them to happen because, through his death, he’s destined to pay a ransom for humankind. Since the fall from paradise, after the first humans  — Adam and Eve — disobeyed Yahweh by eating from the forbidden tree of the knowledge of good and evil every human subsequently born was born wrong; born as an imperfect sinner. The sins of every sinner had to be paid for to avoid damnation and for many years, animal sacrifices were offered as payment. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But then Jesus arrives and offers a deal. If we ask for his forgiveness, he’ll pay with his blood, absolving us of our sins. Jesus’s blood is far more precious than animal or human blood. It has infinite value. So it can absolve infinite sin. As a very young child I didn’t understand this blood magic stuff but I found the crucifixion story very distressing. As I grew up and my involvement in Christianity deepened I’d meditate repeatedly on Jesus’s sacrifice. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Time after time, l’d imagine him dying in agony to pay for my sins and I’d cycle through the same overwhelming feelings. Sorrow, contrition, reverence, incomprehension, powerlessness, thankfulness. It was an emotional mouse wheel that flung rationality away with centrifugal force. But in my early teens, in a crisis of faith I stepped off that mouse wheel for a moment and examined this bloody drama with cold eyes. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And I realised this drama was a farce. Why should we be blamed for being born sinners? Why should we pay for some deficiency over which we had absolutely no control? The fact was, in Biblical terms, the blood-hungry Yahweh was entirely to blame for our sinful nature. When he created Adam, he created him from dust; from earth. So Adam inherited no human sin. If Yahweh created every human this way then no human would be an inherent sinner. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But instead, quite bizarrely, having created Adam from earth, Yahweh now switches to creation from birth a completely different method which he knows will guarantee that every human is an inherent sinner. By commanding Adam and Eve to go forth and multiply, Yahweh deliberately multiplies human sin, multiplies human debt, and multiplies the need for blood sacrifice. We have names for people who deliberately peddle inferior products that demand constant, expensive maintenance work. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
‘Supreme intelligence’ isn’t one of them. John 3:16 tells us that Yahweh loved the world so much that he sacrificed his one and only son. Far from showing love, Jesus’s death is just the melodramatic hook to one of the biggest religious scams in history designed to arouse a combination of profound guilt and gratitude, when we have absolutely no reason to feel either of these. Not only is this blood-magic completely unnecessary, it makes a mockery of personal responsibility. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If people do me wrong, but then apologise and make personal restoration, and I forgive them the matter should be considered resolved. Not so, according to Yahweh. In fact, these wrongdoers could compensate me a hundred times over; a thousand times over. Makes no odds. If they decline to participate in Yahweh’s blood magic by submitting to Jesus, they’ll be condemned. Conversely, If people do me wrong, but offer me no apology or restoration and receive no forgiveness from me, the matter should be considered unresolved. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Again, not so. If they use Yahweh’s blood magic, then they’re absolved. I have decades of experience of countless Christians from various denominations who’ve treated people appallingly — repeatedly stirring conflict, lying, bullying, falsely maligning others. And never making amends for their misdeeds. And yet they go to church each week, recite the Lord’s prayer — maybe confess their sins to a priest and they’re assured that they’re forgiven. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Substitutionary atonement destroys personal accountability. The wrongs we do each other are not magically wiped away by grovelling to the ghost of some Jew executed thousands of years ago. The wrongs we do each other are resolved through human efforts with remorse, integrity, patience, empathy. It can be a messy, uncertain, demanding process. But, unlike scapegoat sacrifice, it’s an honest one. And it gives us back what religions like Christianity try to take from us — the adult autonomy to sort out our own problems and move on from them 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
— instead of submitting to a divine protection racket in which we endlessly pay Yahweh in blood to protect us from Yahweh. Religions like Christianity are divisive to the core. Even if there was only one denomination of Christianity which everyone followed faithfully, the religion itself would still work to come between its followers at all times. In the first of these two videos I looked at Jesus’s demand that we all love him more than anyone else. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Nothing gentle, meek or mild about that. And not content with this already overinflated demand in Luke 14, verse 26, Jesus really lays bare the reach of his narcissism. He demands so much love that — by contrast — our love for everyone else should feel like hate. Unfortunately, some Christians are willing to downgrade their loved ones much more than this. Of the promises of divine love made to me over the years a significant percentage has come from representatives of an organisation that I regard as one of the least qualified to talk about love: Jehovah’s Witnesses. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The concept of separation is deeply embedded in the psychology of the JW organisation which claims that the world has been taken over by Satan, and that all non-Witnesses are morally corrupt. While you might find JWs interacting with non-members on a superficial level, including acts of kindness and charity, their desire to remain ‘separate from the world’ puts a strict limit on these interactions and creates an ‘us vs them’ mentality which allows no middle ground. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If individuals decide to leave the religion, in line with the organisation’s policy the entire JW community, including friends and family, is compelled to dissociate itself from them refusing even to acknowledge them with greetings. The organisation justifies this social shunning with Biblical passages such as 2 John, Matthew 18 and Romans 16 each of which discourages contact with those who don’t follow the party line. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
JW literature presents shunning as ‘loving discipline’ designed to make individuals see the error of their ways and return to the 'truth'. But comments made by the organisation in its Watchtower magazine give a different rationale for shunning asserting that, ‘apostates are ‘mentally diseased,’ and they seek to infect others with their disloyal teachings.’ The fact is this shunning is nothing more than a cruel abuse of social power. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Humans are social creatures. As such, we can be extremely vulnerable to social pressure. The JW organisation exploits this vulnerability to gain compliance. Because they’re discouraged from forming close friendships with non-members shunned apostates are often stripped of their entire social world. Of course there might be an overwhelming urge to return to the flock. Not because the flock represents truth but because of the pain of losing everything and trying to surviving on their own. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Returning to compliance takes the pain away. The isolationist mentality of this organisation shields its members from reality. By remaining separate from the world JWs don’t get to see the lives of the ordinary folks their organisation routinely condemns. Their fantasy of a world overrun by Satan is never challenged. Yes, the world has problems. Yes, there are destructive agents operating in it. But there are also deeply dedicated humanitarian agents working to improve the world. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
By extension, JWs never get to see of lives of the family and friends they shun. If they did, many of them would have to face an uncomfortable truth — that the loved one they’ve shunned is leading a life that’s just as good and honest and loving as it ever was. Let’s underscore this point. Wanda is a Jehovah’s Witness. Lois isn’t. For forty years, they lead virtually identical lives. Both make exactly the same mistakes and do their best to make up for them. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Both give exactly the same time and energy to charity. Both give exactly the same love to their families. The only difference is that, as a Jehovah’s Witness Wanda asks Jesus to take responsibility for her wrongdoings with his blood while Lois accepts responsibility for her own actions. In what way would Wanda be corrupted by associating with Lois? Does Lois’s decision to take responsibility for her own actions make her more or less virtuous than Wanda who wants someone else to pay for hers? Now let’s imagine that the children of both women reveal that they’ve become a buddhist. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Wanda shuns her child, who will now grow up to marry and have children and grandchildren who Wanda will never know. Lois holds onto her child, doesn’t become a buddhist but does enjoy years of mutually rewarding relationships with her son, his wife their children and their grandchildren. Bearing in mind the JWs’ complaint about the destructive forces overrunning the world which of these mothers has contributed more love to the world? Religions that break up friends and families have nothing to teach me about love. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In part one, I mentioned that when I reject their promise of divine love some folks assert that I’ve been somehow ‘damaged’, and express hopes that I might someday be ‘healed’. If I was at all damaged then it was by the warped, avaricious, sadistic pseudo-love peddled by the religion into which I was indoctrinated. If I had to heal from anything, it was this. I had to unlearn the neurotic thinking style instilled in me — the habitual thoughts of unworthiness the constant doubt about whether my love was ever good enough 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
the feeling that my life was not my own the instinctive lack of confidence in my own moral judgement. It’s no coincidence that religions that pontificate endlessly about love constantly neglect one of its most important forms: self love. It’s the subject of corny songs and cheesy internet memes. But for me, self love really forms the grounding of all love. Self love isn’t about being proud or immodest. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It isn’t about deluding ourselves that we have some special importance. It’s about being secure in our self-worth. When we don’t have an abiding internal sense of our own worth we often end up seeking validation from external agents. By giving them the power to control our sense of worth, we become vulnerable to manipulation by those agents. Religious agents in particular are all too happy to prey in that vulnerability. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
I was raised on a distorted parody of love. I didn’t see it was distorted, because everything else in my life was distorted around it to make it look reasonable. For years, I found ways of ignoring the telltale signs — the subjugation, the suffering, the needless overblown sacrifices all of which were silently screaming at me: ‘You’re looking at this from the wrong angle’. But eventually I listened. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The flip in perspective was disorientating. But things finally made sense. And I was able to shed years of distorted thoughts and emotions. I was finally able to solve previously insoluble problems thrown up by these loveless ideologies like: ‘How do you find a moment’s happiness in heaven when you’re conscious of loved ones burning in hell?’ The answer was simple: ‘You don’t.’ Many of us come from generations of folks who’ve had this corrupt model of love drilled into them. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But things are changing. And I know I’m not alone when I say: I reject this degrading ‘love’. [a succession of voices affirming: I reject this degrading ‘love’.] 
</p>
</div>
<br>
