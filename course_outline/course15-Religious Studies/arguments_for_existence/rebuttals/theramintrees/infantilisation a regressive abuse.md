title: "infantilisation a regressive abuse"

<br>

<div>
<p>
There are lots of positives to being a child. One of those positives underpins the TheraminTrees channel icon. The image of a floating foetus in adult clothes — originally a tuxedo — came from a dream in my teens. For me, what came through in the image was the idea of preserving the fresh unjaded eyes we possess at birth. For a brief time, our curiosity about the world is un-cluttered by dogma and tribalism. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Our minds haven’t yet been colonised by any partisan prejudices from the communities into which we’re randomly born. We don’t see the bogus social divisions constructed by certain groups and attributed with spurious meaning. When their assertions don’t make sense we question them unselfconsciously. When the answers are inadequate we say so without inhibition. This kind of sincere reality testing offers us the most solid foundation for acquiring skills, knowledge and understanding. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Not solid in terms of rigidity and inflexibility. As a species we seem repeatedly to learn and forget, re-learn and re-forget that fixed dogmatic mindsets lead us down disastrous pathways. Solid in terms of resourcefulness. Instead of clinging to a bogus idea so that when it sinks, we sink with it we’re able to adapt —&nbsp;to recognise its bogus nature and step away into new insight. The child-like instinct to question freely is a precious strength worth preserving. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But instead of nurturing this and other strengths many individuals and groups try to preserve the child’s vulnerabilities to meet various psychological needs of their own. The child might be seen as a blank canvas to be filled with all the unexamined tribal superstitions and traditions of previous generations and charged with passing them on wholesale to the next. The child might be groomed as an enabler trained to affirm and support the comforting illusions of egotists. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The child might be idealised by individuals and groups who venerate innocence and view worldly knowledge and experience as contaminants to what they see as a perfect untouched state. The child gets depersonalised into a slave, a pet, a toy, an ornament. Instead of being encouraged and celebrated the child’s development is actively sabotaged in an attempt to preserve the most vulnerable qualities of infanthood: ignorance, inexperience, incompetence, dependence. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The growing individual becomes infantilised. Infantilisation is an extremely common manipulation in which individuals are treated in ways that deny their maturity or mental capacity. It’s also one of the most slippery forms of manipulation. Unlike more overtly abusive tactics it’s often disguised as other things, like affection. Infantilising abusers claim their babying behaviour is an expression of love. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But it’s not love. It’s a cage that gets progressively more confining. As their world shrinks targets of infantilisation feel increasingly confined and immobilised. They anticipate failing, and not being able to cope. I want to explore this manipulative tactic and some of its insidious features. I’ll be using real-life examples, mainly from families and religion. But it can happen wherever power dynamics exist: abusive one-to-one relationships, politics, education, the workplace. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And I invite you to notice any personal parallels in your own experience. Our first experience of one-up one-down relationships are the ones we’re born into. We enter the world powerless into the care of people who hold all the power. People we call family. For that first vulnerable part of our lives they govern every aspect of our existence from our appearance to the food we eat to the company we keep. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Fathers and mothers are kings and queens exercising all-encompassing sovereignty. Older siblings, next in line to the throne also hold significant influence. In healthy families, this monarchy is benevolent and fleeting. Parents recognise they’re the temporary guardians of their offspring not their owners or their eternal rulers. Their absolute power doesn’t corrupt absolutely. It’s channelled positively into helping the child develop into a self-sufficient, independent individual. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And as the child acquires knowledge and experience the one-up one-down relationship resolves into an equal adult relationship. Parents remain parents in name and bonds of love and affection continue. But the functional role of ‘parenting’ ceases. All parties are self-directing now, free of any role-based remnants. When you come from a positive family environment like that it’s sometimes hard to conceive of the countless families where parents become perpetual dictators, lazy with power; where roles are malignantly distorted and children are used 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
to satisfy unmet needs and fantasies and act out unresolved issues. Adultification happens when the child is prematurely assigned adult roles and responsibilities they’re not ready for. Spousification puts the child in a quasi-partner role opening the door to emotional if not physical incest. Parentification describes a role reversal in which the child is expected to look after the parent. Like all of these corruptions of the parental role infantilisation stems from a refusal to acknowledge the child as a fully separate person. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Infantilisation is an assault from multiple directions. It manifests in a variety of ways each one intended to erode some aspect of the individual that confers mature status. One example is a refusal to acknowledge age-appropriate boundaries. Despite 8-year-old Dominic’s repeated suggestions that he’s old enough to bathe himself his father continues to bathe him. Finally Dominic takes the initiative and bathes himself. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Finding the bathroom door locked, his father is furious and says if Dominic doesn’t need his help bathing he won’t get any more help with anything. Dominic is subjected to a lengthy silent treatment. This real-life example illustrates the no-win scenario that plays out in infantalising families, ideological groups, and workplaces. Targets start from an undermined position. If they ask permission to advance, it’s denied. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If they dare to take matters into their own hands and demonstrate their competence, they're punished. All roads point back to square one. In healthy families, parents respect and foster their children’s emerging desire for independence and privacy. Punishing children for exercising these important boundaries can create lasting conflicted impulses where privacy and independence become associated with guilt and anxiety. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
35-year-old Karen is publicly scolded at a family wedding when her mother discovers a small dove discreetly tattooed on her back. Instead of asking about the deeply personal symbolism and learning something about Karen’s life her mother takes it as evidence of juvenile rebelliousness. 30-year-old Isolde’s father constantly recommends weight loss programs and always prescribes low-calorie food for her when they eat together in private or public. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
When she tactfully tries to sidestep his interference he pushes the point until things get tense. It’s as if Karen and Isolde don’t own their own bodies. They’re just renting them from their parental landlords who expect their property to be maintained to their specification. Because of their delusion of ownership they misinterpret their daughters’ exercise of bodily autonomy as acts of personal rebellion against them. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Infantilising parents break all kinds of boundaries. They decide who their offspring can be friends with. They turn up at workplaces, making scenes. They assume charge of their grandchildren without consultation. Honouring boundaries is one of the most basic expressions of respect we show other people. It demonstrates that we recognise their fundamental governance over their own existence. And it’s for that reason that crossing boundaries without invitation is reserved for very specific circumstances 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
for example when people are incapable of caring for themselves or where there’s a threat of harm. And even in those cases, situations are assessed to make sure that crossing boundaries is genuinely justified. When boundaries are casually ignored it’s an act of disrespect and dominance. The building — and maintenance — of solid boundaries is one of the most crucial and one of the most difficult aspects of overcoming infantilisation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Later on I’ll be looking at what that involves including some traps to avoid. Dominic’s bath time experience illustrates another aspect of infantilisation: the persistent withholding of credit. Targets’ knowledge, experience and skills are habitually dismissed. The assumption is they can’t do anything. At her 30th birthday party organised by her aunt Ingrid says she wants to take a group photo. Her father orders her to give him the camera — she’s bound to do it wrong. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Later, when she begins to cut her birthday cake her father snatches the knife and takes over telling her what a mess she’s making. Whatever she tries to do —&nbsp;open some champagne, put some music on, organise games — he swoops in and stops her. Many targets of infantilisation are subjected to relentless debilitating micromanagement. The expected outcome is always failure. And that expectation is used to prevent the target from trying. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It’s a circular self-fulfilling prophecy. Preventing targets from trying prevents them from learning which will tend to produce failure, which is then used to justify preventing the target trying. Ironically, Ingrid is a far more capable and accomplished person than her father. But like many targets, she’s had to acquire all her skills and experience elsewhere away from her abuser. Her capabilities go unrecognised. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And on the rare times she demonstrates her proficiency it’s dismissed as a fluke. In the same way, the extensive talents of people in infantilising religious and political groups go untapped because their ideology considers them a subordinate class of human being. They’re denied leadership roles and positions on judging panels and confined to menial tasks. It’s not an unrelated fact that those groups are often run by incompetent twits. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Sometimes, the withholding of credit is falsely wrapped up as concern. In his mid-20s, Nikolai flies out to a holiday resort to meet his parents for a vacation. On his first morning he says he’s going for a swim in the sea. His mother descends into histrionics insisting his father chaperones the strong swimmer in case he drowns. Eventually, to placate her, the two men walk down to the beach where Nikolai has a joyless swim conscious of his father’s resentment — and his own. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It’s a grindingly familiar experience. Nikolai’s mother justifies her constant demeaning interventions with an air of maternal martyrdom claiming ‘I can’t help fussing. I’m a mother!’ But while she endlessly fusses, she never actually helps. In fact she’s been conspicuously out of sync with Nikolai’s needs ever since he was born. As he’ll eventually discover, she has a malignant personality disorder and never felt anything approaching maternal love. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Which is why her so-called assistance only ever created problems; and why whenever real help was needed she always made excuses and a swift exit. Her bouts of infantilising fussing were just cartoonish performances of what she thought maternal love looked like. Aside from trying to extract affirmation for herself for being a doting mother these performances highlight another element of infantilisation found in many areas of abuse. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Targets are trained to fear the outside world. Members of religious organisations are warned that the world is in the grip of evil supernatural entities. Political ideologues are taught to view non-members as either malevolent or enablers of malevolence. Citizens are whipped into divisive paranoia by corrupt governments. Instilling fear is designed to draw targets close with the message ‘I’ll keep you safe’; to encourage the voluntary surrender of freedoms and discourage targets from exploring a world 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
they might find complex, beautiful and engaging. As a result, members of religious and political groups cloister themselves in likeminded bubbles blocking and shunning dissenting opinions. Citizens offer limitless personal data to governments and corporate giants with child-like trust, believing their best interests will be served. And children grow up having never known an unsupervised moment or been allowed to develop age-appropriate self-management skills including the ability to deal with conflict 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
without appealing to external authorities to intervene and dispense justice. The persistent diminishing nature of infantilisation distinguishes it from authentic protectiveness and concern. Healthy parents don’t diminish their offspring. Healthy partners don’t diminish their mates. They don’t use their loved ones’ failures to shame them or disqualify them from further attempts. They understand that working through failure is how we develop. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Healthy groups don’t restrict contact with non-members. They understand that other perspectives —&nbsp;including critical perspectives — can, like failure, be an important source of growth. The abusive nature of infantilising protectiveness also reveals itself in the actions taken against people who try to opt out of it. Responses of emotional blackmail, smear campaigns, shunning, silencing, even threats of violence make it clear who targets really needed to protect themselves from. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Another infantilising tactic that masquerades as something positive is perpetual wallowing in an idealised past. Whenever 36-year old Ty speaks with his mother she embarks on the same long-winded script. In a bedtime story voice, she rehashes vaseline-lensed memories she’s recounted hundreds of times about his early childhood. The stories are littered with the same one-liners: ‘Why did you have to grow up?’ ‘You’ll always be my little baby.’ Ty recalls none of these old memories and hearing them endlessly repeated 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
leaves him feeling disconnected and claustrophobic. It’s as if his life stopped when he was three years old at the start of what his mother calls his ‘difficult years’ ie when he began developing an independent personality. They were certainly difficult for Ty whose growing independence was met with rages, silence treatments and exclusion including being banished from the house for hours and left to roam the streets. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Decades later, still unwilling to acknowledge her son as an independent person, she continues to try and drag him back to those first three years when she felt like the centre of his universe. Many abusers repeatedly hark back to a few scant good times to try and block out the years of abuse that truly characterise the relationship and immerse the target in a haze of artificial wistfulness. A sober assessment of just how few good times there actually were will give a fair indication of just how few good times there are to come. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
With infantilisation, memories of helplessness and vulnerability are specifically selected to put the target back in that psychological state. Another common strand of infantilisation is that the target’s sexuality is denied or obstructed. When Leo and his partner are invited to spend the weekend at his parents’ house his father tells him they’ll have to sleep separately. No other couples get treated this way. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Sleeping arrangements during family visits are a battleground for many folks. Adults are treated like unruly adolescents and barred from sleeping with their own partners. Controlling religious and pseudoscience groups often try to impede or eliminate sexuality among their members. Masturbation is frequently forbidden. Leaders of groups like the Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Mormons have presumed to dictate to married couples what kinds of sex they can and can’t have. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
These invasions are designed to teach targets that even in the most private aspects of their relationships and their bodies they remain under royal rulership. In working with clients like Leo who’ve experienced parental intrusion on their sexuality, I’ve presented the following hypothetical. Imagine that whenever you visit your parents before you’re allowed to enter, you and your partner have to consent to them slapping you both round the face. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
How likely would you be to visit them? Invariably the answer is: not very likely. The next question is: How does that differ from what your parents are already doing? Parents who insist on separate beds for their offspring and partners are telling them their relationship is invalid; that there’s something unacceptable about it that disqualifies it from respect. When offspring submit to these intrusions they’re tacitly validating their own invalidation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They’re allowing themselves and their partners to be slapped round the face. It’ll always be up to offspring&nbsp;and their partners to decide what intrusions they’re prepared to tolerate from their parents and partner’s parents. Just as employees have to decide what intrusions they tolerate from their employers; citizens from their governments; religious followers from their religious leaders. But the consequences of giving in to invalidating power plays are not to be underestimated. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
When we act like submissive children our emotions and thoughts follow. We feel and think like submissive children. We regress to a meek one-down permission-seeking position hoping for respect rather than expecting it. As we become smaller, we become more vulnerable to further encroachment. Likewise, when we respond as adults we feel and think like adults. We operate from an equal position and we’re clear  about the respect we’re entitled to from loved ones. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Prior to his visit, Leo gave his father some chances to reconsider his position. Three times he stated he and his partner would expect to sleep together. After his father’s third rejection of the idea Leo informed him they wouldn’t be visiting. When Leo’s resolve became clear his father had a rethink and accepted his terms. Leo avoided some common traps targets fall into when they’re building boundaries with infantilising people. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
One trap is to try to argue their case with the infantilising individual or explain why they deserve respect. It’s not up to targets to come up with reasons why they should be treated with basic consideration. A variation of this trap is bargaining for respect. Some targets try offering some concession or compromise to gain basic consideration. But that just keeps them in a one-down position giving respect freely but paying for the respect they receive. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Another trap is bluffing. When targets lay out what’ll happen if they’re mistreated they need to be prepared to follow through with those consequences. To be taken seriously, targets need to be serious. A final trap worth mentioning is losing control. Frustrating as it is to be infantilised lashing out just lives down to expectations and feeds into the child-like image that’s already being peddled. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Anger is an extremely useful emotional fuel when it’s harnessed and focussed. And for many targets it plays a huge part in ending their abuse. It can galvanise us; sustain our determination. There’s even evidence it can sharpen our information-processing skills. In their 2007 paper ‘Thinking straight while seeing red’ Wesley Moons and Diane Mackie found that angry individuals were more likely to discriminate between weak and strong arguments than individuals in neutral moods and that anger encouraged analytical processing 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
even in individuals who didn’t have strong analytical predispositions. But when anger runs wild its constructive potential collapses into destructive potential which can backfire on the target. All these traps spring from the same basic mistake. Targets are over-valuing their abusers’ respect. By chasing their respect, they give their abusers a hold over them. When targets turn their focus inward on their own self-respect there’s often a natural shift. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They stop behaving like second-class citizens and start occupying their full adult space. In milder cases where there’s no deep pathology a bit of sustained adult resistance can sometimes shake infantilising individuals out of their misguided behaviour —&nbsp;although it’s worth preparing for some subsequent backsliding and doubling down in some cases. But at the malignant end, where individuals and groups are entrenched in deeply disordered power fantasies it’s time to think about creating serious personal distance 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
— reducing or terminating contact. In many religions  —&nbsp;certainly the Abrahamic ones — infantilisation is intrinsically woven into the central divine concept. The god character described in scriptural creation myths designs an immeasurably inferior species called human beings who are prevented from ever attaining the god’s knowledge, skills or understanding. Humans are kept in deliberate ignorance and obliged to obey without comprehension. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The Biblical creation myth frames this diminished infantilised state as perfection, purity, innocence. This innocent state is venerated as the pinnacle of human existence. That innocence is then despicably abused. In the creation myth, the god character makes a garden paradise called Eden and creates the first man, Adam, to look after it. He then creates the first woman, Eve, to be Adam’s helper. The pair of them are left to wander round the garden where they’re allowed to eat the fruit of any tree. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
With a bizarre exception. The god character chooses the garden of Eden as the location for two magic trees: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. He directs Adam and Eve not to eat from the second of these warning them they’ll die when they do. But everything’s okay. He’s created them innocent — ie, ignorant, inexperienced and obedient. What could go wrong? Well, just about everything. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
A talking serpent, described variously as subtle, crafty and cunning tells the innocent Eve she won’t die if she eats the fruit. Instead, she’ll become wise like the god character. She eats — and persuades Adam to eat. And true to the serpent’s word, they don’t die&nbsp;and they gain wisdom. As a sign of their lost innocence, they dress themselves in leaves. The god character then punishes them for disobedience casting them from Eden before they can eat the fruit of the other magic tree — the tree of life, which would give them immortality. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This creation myth illustrates why innocence is not something to be venerated. Adam and Eve were presented with conflicting statements which they weren’t equipped to process. When the serpent said they wouldn’t die he meant the mere act of eating the fruit wouldn’t instantly kill them. When the god character said they’d die when they ate from the tree he meant he would personally enforce their eventual death. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In fact it was his deliberately misleading phrasing that caused the whole problem. We can safely call it deliberately misleading because, being an all-knowing deity, he would’ve known how Adam and Eve would misinterpret it. He would’ve known that if he’d simply told them he would cast them out and let them die the serpent’s statement wouldn’t’ve conflicted with his. And of course he knew they had no capacity to process the conflicting information they were given. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They were punished for failing a test they were designed to fail. The failure lies completely with the god character. If he wanted to preserve human innocence it was his job to create an environment where it would never be jeopardised. In Biblical mythology, the omnipotent, omniscient god character was perfectly capable of creating that environment if he’d really wanted to. Having just created an entire universe he could’ve placed his magic trees out of reach on some distant planet. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In fact there’s no explanation for why they even had to exist. He could’ve made humans unable to communicate with anyone but him. If he wanted to preserve their ignorance he could’ve created them without curiosity. For an all-knowing all-powerful deity there’d be many simple and obvious measures to avoid jeopardising human innocence. The fact none of those measures were employed indicates stupidity, incompetence, negligence or active sadism. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Unlike the mythical god of the Bible humans don’t have the magical power to engineer environments where innocence can be sustained. And yet many still venerate innocence still work to preserve it in their children and still punish them for worldly knowledge. The disastrous result is that countless children who are kept in a state of ignorance and inexperience are left wide open to exploitation — a prime example being children who are given no knowledge of sex or sexuality and become easy prey for molesters. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This combination of denying sexuality and venerating innocence is particularly poisonous. At school, one of 14-year-old Jasmine’s friends brings in one of her mother’s old copies of Playgirl. They giggle at the pictures of the men. Jasmine’s friend tears off a page for her to keep. She hides it under her bed. Coming back from school one day she finds the picture gone. Later, her mother comes in brandishing the picture. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
She cuts it in two, tears up the body and saves the head. She threatens to show it to Jasmine’s father — let him know what a depraved little girl she is. She continues to dangle that threat over her daughter keeping Jasmine suspended in a limbo of shame, fear and anxiety. The blackmail only stops when her mother inadvertently reveals where she keeps the photo and Jasmine musters the courage to destroy it. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Many years later, having grappled with severe trust and shame issues Jasmine reminded her mother about that period of blackmail in her teens. Her mother said she just couldn’t stand the fact her baby was growing up. She wanted Jasmine to stay her sweet little girl forever. Another big motif infantilising families and religions share is the practice of trying to instil a permanent sense of debt. Some parents try to extract gratitude with the line: ‘I gave you life!’ As if they did you some favour. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They didn’t. Before you were conceived, you weren’t some potential person waiting in the wings, hoping for life. There was no ‘you’. Your birth wasn’t a gift to you. It was your parents’ gift to themselves. They gave themselves a child. To demand gratitude for a gift you give yourself is absurd. Infantilising religions teach followers to prostrate themselves in gratitude to their gods for giving them life. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But again, if any of those gods existed there’d be nothing to thank them for. In Abrahamic mythology, the god character doesn’t give the human race life. He gives himself a human race to rule over. He gives himself an empire. An act of birth or creation is nothing to be grateful for. It’s a completely self-serving act on the part of the parent. It’s what parents do for their children once they’re born that counts. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And even then, many of the things often characterised as gifts to the child are actually parental duties. It’s no gift to children to feed them, clothe them, shelter them, protect them, nurture them. Those are just basic responsibilities the parents took on when they decided to have children. And even these bare essentials aren’t fulfilled by any god characters who are conspicuous in their absence. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Gifts by definition are given freely. Trying to instil a sense of permanent debt proves there are no parental gifts being bestowed here. It also indicates a very manipulative mindset. In healthy relationships, people don’t try to trap each other with guilt, obligation and debt. They stick around because they like each other. I’ll end with one more feature: the use of belittling language. Targets are often addressed with juvenile pet names or terms that insinuate immaturity —&nbsp;like ‘young man’ or ‘young woman’. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
As with other aspects of infantilisation, behaviour determines context. When the actions are friendly and respectful, there’s no sting. When the actions are patronising and diminishing, the words become charged. In religious groups infantilising language is sometimes formally built into job titles. Congregations like the Christian one I was forced into as a child are taught to address priests as ‘Father’ — an explicitly infantilising term. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The perversity of this parent-child dynamic is highlighted when elderly parishioners call young priests ‘Father’. I personally avoided using this title. I called our priests ‘the vicar’. The title ‘Father’ seemed creepy for reasons I couldn’t pinpoint at the time. I can pinpoint them now. I was being directed to relate to these total strangers like I was their son bypassing the establishment of any personal relationships or the building of any trust. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Just like it was with the heavenly father those things were expected to magically snap into existence from nothing. They didn’t. We mess around with some very important survival instincts when we try to shortcut children’s natural caution around strangers. Some religious scripture descends into animalistic imagery comparing followers to flocks of sheep presided over by shepherds. As a child I remember recoiling from this insulting image. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But in retrospect it was a lot more apt than parent-child language. Shepherds don’t look after sheep out of kindness or love. They look after sheep so long as they’re useful — in the sheep’s case, useful for wool, meat and profit. The truth of this metaphor has been experienced by millions of people reared in religious communities who learned their value was conditional on their utility and who discovered that those surrogate families who ‘lovingly protected’ them from knowledge and experience were happy to cut them dead in a heartbeat when their usefulness expired. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Infantilisation often comes disguised as love, affection, playfulness, protection. But when those things are genuine they don’t leave us feeling suffocated, debilitated, paralysed. They don’t leave us dependent, anxious and neurotic. If we’re feeling any of those things, it’s time for a reality check. We don’t get to choose the company we’re born into. But we do get to choose the company we keep. In most of the real-life cases recounted here the infantilised offspring eventually claimed their freedom 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
implementing no contact or minimal contact with rigorous boundaries. A couple of individuals struggled to translate their awareness into action and continued to allow draining levels of contact with their abusive parents. Infantilised targets often put up with excessive demands for contact from their abusers —&nbsp;exhausting daily phone calls and over-extended visits. They’ve been trained to give abusers as much of their personal time as the abusers want, whenever they want it. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>

Limiting contact often facilitates lots of other positive changes. With strong time boundaries in place abusers have fewer chances to violate other boundaries because the target isn’t there. Time apart can help to shed old infantilised habits and strengthen new adult ones. Many targets wrestle with the question of how much contact is reasonable. Is a five-minute phone call too short? Is fifteen minutes more reasonable? This kind of overthinking by targets reflects their anticipation of being judged.

To get out of that frame of mind it’s useful for targets to get into the habit of imagining how they’d answer if they were guaranteed no judgement. So, if you knew you weren’t going to be judged for it how much contact would you want to have with this person? Whatever answer you give is reasonable. Framing questions in this way reveals our real feelings. Being on guard against the manipulative tactic of infantilisation doesn’t mean we have to put away all childish things.

We’re the sum of all our experiences — experiences in our childhood, our adolescence and our adulthood. There’s nothing unhealthy about fondly revisiting the games, books, TV and films we enjoyed in our childhood. The music for this video is a choral version of a piece I’ve loved ever since I heard it on a tinny old cassette player when I was five: Camille Saint-Saëns’s ‘The cuckoo in the depths of the woods’.

Growing up isn’t about giving up our past, but expanding on it. Being stretched and enriched by experience. There’s nothing unhealthy about enjoying child-like affection and playfulness in our adult relationships. The problem arises when the relationship operates coercively on that child-like level. Becoming aware of the subtle slippery elements of that coercion and recognising the difference between care and confinement are the first steps in breaking free from the cage of infantilisation.
