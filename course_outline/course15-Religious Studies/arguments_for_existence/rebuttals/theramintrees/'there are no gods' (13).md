This is an answer to Saizai - I hope I pronounce it correctly - Who asks me what I thought when I was theist And what I think now. I could answer these questions in a few seconds - or a few hours I'm going to be content with a compromise and try to treat a range of ideas in three videos It will not be exhaustive But I hope it will give a suitable overview where I come from. So first question: - What belief did I have exactly before my conversion - including its limits or uncertainties, But without explicitly trying to discredit it?

What I thought was covering a large number of things My beliefs have changed substantially during the time I was a Christian In two words, I will share this time in three main phases The "Santa Claus" phase: In my bonus childhood, I believed everything I was told, without critical thinking including biblical or modern miraculous interventions. I thought that the Christian God I had made to believe in indoctrination was a kind of benevolent uncle, An omniscient Santa Claus.

I thought he could do everything, without limits And that he smiled when we were good, was sad when we were bad. My understanding of biblical episodes was also sanitized For example, in the story of Noah as I told me at school God saw a deluge promise and warns Noah so that he can warn everyone This edulcoration was destroyed when I saw John Huston's film "La Bible" Thanks to this film, and my questions and readings that followed, I live a picture very different from this god.

The "psychosis" phase: I would not have been able to put a word on it at the time But today the qualifier that seems to me to be suitable is that of psychopath. For example, I was horrified to learn that God had not been content to predict the deluge It was his desire to perpetrate a deliberate genocide. Other cruel and deliberate actions shocked me Like the story of Job, whose life was ruined when God agreed to be the subject of a bet with Satan.

But the story that marked me the most at the time was the way Abraham was tested to whom God asked to sacrifice his son Isaac. I found this story deeply destabilizing when I was a child, It horrifies me to think that God can expose someone to a mental torture so long Forcing him to consider the murder of this child. And then there was the obedience of Abraham Who was really ready to kill Isaac. Would my parents be ready to kill me if God asked them? What if Abraham had refused to kill his son? After all, when Adam and Eve disobeyed him, after being deceived on the consequences of their act

It punishes the whole human species! I always believed in God, But the image I had of him had been destroyed. In Robert Graves' book "Me, Claude" When Caligula returns victorious from an imaginary battle with the god Neptune, He entered a violent anger when he realized that no fanfare was there to cheer him on. The Roman senators were terrified And specified that it was Caligula himself who had decided that there would be no triumphant welcome. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Caligula then reprimanded them for having taken it to the word, tells them that he had left them the opportunity to show him their love by disobeying him And by preparing a triumphant welcome to him. This test was a trap since, although they do it, they could be punished. It's the same with this god who asks you to do something that you know how to be bad, like a murder, and put yourself in a situation where you cannot win Leaving only the choice in the transgression that you will commit.

The stories of Noah and Abraham were only two examples among many who changed my emotions by leaving only anxiety. The security that I felt before had disappeared, Replaced by apprehension and vulnerability. La Phase Binker ( 8 / 12 ans ) : in this phase, which lasted up to my twelve years "Yesu" became the object of my belief, eclipses, and to a large extent attenuating The dark unpredictability of God.

I was electrified by the side against intuitive of its positions fraternizing with prostitutes Admoning the piles for their judgments and their hypocrisy. I found this reversal of radical and stimulating concepts And I started to re -examine my position on good and evil. While God was incomprehensible, avenger and he stretched traps "Yesu" seemed consistent, merciful and transparent. Things started turning round What God was, now his Son had become, a benevolent presence that watched over us Who smiled when we were good, and who was sad when we were bad.

The way he had been betrayed and tortured also played on protective feelings but also guilt by association Because of what we humans had made him undergo. He seemed emotionally welcoming and loaded with drama. I managed to make a distinction between God and "Yesu" A bit like monkeys in Hollow's experience on wire mothers managing to maintain my commitment to a god But firmly wrapped in the psychological comfort provided by Christ.

I thought that the goal of Christianity was to follow the example of Christ My faith was not a license to judge, it was God's job There was no question of displaying piety in a hypocritical way or to know who would be the most virtuous but rather to be a good neighbor Seeking what is good in others, treating them with respect and understanding to strive to be virtuous And to work for a better world.

Here it was, these were the three main phases of my belief That, as I said before, I broke out for the sake of brevity. When a professor of religious education asked me to question my belief It was an explosion of variations in my ideas, all concentrated in a very short period of time. I started using metaphorical rather than literal interpretations. I even stumbled on the edge of a cross towards evangelism.

I sincerely prayed that what was there, somewhere, communicates with me live. At this point, I felt like I was to make my way Between the contradictory opinions of people on what God was And I wanted to put it all aside and find God thanks to God himself. In my childhood, the limit between true and imaginary relationships were blurred. Children, we had learned to maintain relationships with all kinds of inanimate objects.

We had learned the double-thought Inventing a psychic life for our toys Then believing that these interior lives really existed, regardless of us. We become skilful in a whole series of reasoning that allow us to project our own ideas outside Before they come back as if they came from an independent external source. Previously, I used these kinds of reasoning to get a response to my prayers that I perceived in signs I gave meaning.

When I stopped playing answers in this way And started looking for clear and unambiguous answers, I found none. I tested other religions. Even if my belief had gone, I continued to examine the affirmations, as if I still believed Hoping that my belief would come back. Ironically, it was fun to see, years later that it is the advice that Pascal gave in his "thoughts" Addressing those who had trouble believing.

But my faith never returned And my atheism began when I finally admitted the simple but deep truth: The dialogue of a single interlocutor is a monologue. In the next two videos, I will talk about what I think now Starting by the fact that I believe that the gods in whom I firmly believed ... do not exist.
