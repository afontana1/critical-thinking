title: "rebuttals to 'betting on infinity'"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
Here is a continuation of the video "betting on the infinity" that Qualiasoup and I had made, on the bet of Pascal. Some Christians have advanced various criticism in response, and it is a useful exercise to review these criticism. 1) Pascal's use of the word "incomprehensible" has been distorted It was said that it was a distortion of what Pascal meant by "incomprehensible". It has been said that the use of the word by Pascal allowed the possibility of understanding God in terms of "what we understand that God is". 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The problem is that Pascal said precisely what we said. According to the 233 fragment of thoughts: "We are therefore unable to know or what it is, or if it is". Why is it important in the eyes of our detractors to say that Pascal never said that? Well, I think the pain point is this: "nor if He is." To say that we are unable to know what something leaves the possibility of its existence is open.In fact, this implies its existence. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But to say that we are unable to know if it exists is a completely different affirmation.This makes atheism not only reasonable, but unassailable. It is now impossible to claim that there is an abundance of evidence of a deity whose atheists knowingly do not take into account. For if such evidence existed, then we would be able to know whether divinity exists. The argument concerning "what we understand that God is" has different flaws.We are not talking about understanding a description, we are talking about understanding the object itself. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We could discuss what we understand that Sherlock Holmes, a completely invented character.The ability to understand a description of a thing is not an Olympic feat, and this in no way answers the question of the existence of this thing. Another problem is the expression "monotheistic premise", which excludes by its own formulation polytheistic religions. On the contrary, it should be premise.But the main problem with the expression was a bit object of the video: what we understand about the essence of the gods is not the subject of a consensus, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This creates a paralyzing number of incompatible and contradictory concepts, even within the same religion. 2) Making so many arguments against Pascal's bet was inconsistent A theist has accused us of a strange inconsistency. He said that since we had said that God was absolutely incomprehensible, then we should have stopped there, because that would mean that Pascal's arguments are meaningless, and that there would be no point in continuing. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
He said that by continuing to highlight additional contradictions in Pascal's work, we were inconsistency. This amounts to saying that if it is said that the Bible is not the Word of God, one can then then analyze the different individual passages to produce additional arguments. You have to stop immediately, or we then show inconsistency. (But there is nothing inconsistent to identify multiple faults). 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
I included this criticism, because it is a very familiar example of the stifling contortions to which some engage in trying to make a criticism when they actually have absolutely no rational argument. 3) Pascal did not say that rituals create belief We have shown Pascal's ideas on how to develop religious beliefs in any person: "by taking holy water, making masses say, etc. Of course it will make you believe". 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Our detractors have claimed that this is not what Pascal was saying. What you see above ("by taking holy water, making masses say, etc. Of course it will make you believe") is a direct quote from Pascal. In the sentences which preceded it, Pascal imagined a person who declared "I am made in such a way that I cannot believe. So what do you want me to do?" This was Pascal's response to this person. Want the source? “Thoughts”, fragment 233. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
4) Qualifying the bet as "mercenary" is unfair It has been said to call Pascal's bet a mercenary bet is unreasonable. "Larousse: mercenary adj. Who only works for a salary, who is inspired..." That seems like the ideal description to me. If you can find me a better word that means doing something for a reward, and not out of conviction, I'm all ears. We found fault with our criticism of the “blocking of reason”. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
5) Pascal's bet is rational It was said that Pascal's bet was rational. Pascal himself said that the bet was not rational.He explicitly said: "Reason can not determine anything." That's kind of the whole point of the bet. So to maintain that the latter is rational is not only false, it amounts to contradicting Pascal. 6) Blocking rationality has no impact on scientific facts We also found fault with our idea that blocking rationality has an impact on relationships with rational people and scientific facts. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Some people could not make the link.So I will develop. Pascal's idea was that the individual must silence their intelligence, to stop asking questions that could remove them from belief. But if the individual can stop, other people won't. Rational people will serve as a permanent recall to these questions, and their words must be rejected or distorted. Scientific facts like evolution will have to be rejected or distorted, into belief systems that give divine explanations inconsistent with these facts about our origin. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It is not simply theoretical: we see the consequences every day, when rational people and scientific facts are marginalized in order to preserve religious ideas. (Fundamentalist claims: 'Do not teach the evolution - teach the controversy on the subject!' 'Even Darwin said that the idea that the eye evolved was 'highly absurd.' 'Carbon 14 dating is absolutely not reliable for dates exceeding 4000 years.') 7) Pascal did not say anything about "to numb his mind" It was claimed that Pascal said nothing about numbing his mind. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Let us return to the proposed effects of religious rituals. Here is Pascal in the original French: "Naturally even this will make you believe and will stupid you." Yes, there are different translations in English, but they differ on "abêtir", which means to stupefy, to make someone unable to think straight. Once again, stop arguing with me, these are the direct words of Pascal. 8) The multitude of religions that exist does not shake the bet Another criticism is only to have shown all Christian religions and denominations does not discredit the bet, it simply means that it is necessary to be more prudent in its choices. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Uh no. And the decisive idea for this, which seems to have been missed, is the threat of eternal torture for having chosen the wrong god ("You shall have no other gods before me", book of Exodus 20 :3). If you think that doesn't undermine the claims of the bet ("If you lose, you lose nothing"), then you haven't understood the bet at all. Because if you choose the wrong god, wrongly, then your loss is infinite. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
9) Overestimation of the number of gods It has been claimed that we have overestimated the number of incomprehensible gods. It was claimed that some descriptions were implausible. I find the irony staggering that someone who criticizes implausibility has no problem believing that two individuals of every animal species on Earth were all put together in one big boat. Do you know how many spider species there are?More than forty thousand.And it is only for spiders. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Has Noé received the list of all species?How did he keep his eye on those he had to recover?How did he know when to stop looking for even more spiders? Here are some things to think about before we start talking about the concept of implausibility. But to answer the problem of plausibility more directly: what humans find plausible or implausible does not determine reality. Lots of people found implausible the idea that our earth revolves around the sun, instead of the opposite.Has their feeling of implausibility had the slightest effect on this heliocentric reality? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
No. There is also a kind of redefinition that is being implemented. Some critics wanted to dismiss the Greek gods, the Roman gods, or the Norse gods, calling them powerful, but not all-powerful. Let's take a closer look, to examine a word they have in common. "Gods". What were we talking about? Gods. These aren't a category like superheroes that are snuck in and re-labeled "gods", they are defined as gods. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And this attempt to change the definition of the word "gods" to exclude them perfectly illustrates why some critics say we overestimate the number of gods. This is because they want to exclude anyone who does not fit their personal definition. Well, we boldly take a wider overview, and we include in our list of gods defined as being gods. 10) “What if” scenarios non-divine were weird Here is a clear case of an argument from disbelief. As with the implausible, what people find strange does not serve as an argument. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And here's why. If you reject what you personally find weird, you will also have to reject what other people find weird, which will inevitably include your belief system. Be careful about the reasons you argue, you will have to defend your own belief system for those same reasons. 11) Moralizing conclusion By the way, this sentence ("we can, on the contrary, invest in 'tangible' by exploring our universe with honesty and intellectual rigor, living with respect and conscience among our fellows.") Was qualified as moralizing and preaching. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This setting where no instructions are given, no one is told what to do, where we simply state an option (“We can” do this). It's an invitation. And, oh my God. If you are that sensitive to preaching, I wonder how you manage to get out of church alive every week. Do you remember where the verb comes from? "Preach, verb: To deliver a sermon to a group of people, typically in a church". Again, as with the "plausible", those who live in glass houses had better not throw stones at the neighbor. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
12) Ethical standards cannot be compared to the laws of physics It has been claimed that in our invitation to respect our fellow human beings, we are comparing ethical norms to the laws of physics. This is one of the most unruly nonsense of the job.A pure and simple man of straw.Where did we say that ethical norms are like the laws of physics? Or? This is just completely meaningless rhetoric. To sum up, the counter-arguments presented to us are clearly a collection of straw men, arguments of disbelief, true Scots fallacies, distorted descriptions and blatantly incorrect accusations of misrepresentation. 
</p>

<p>
I've left out a lot of the more personal attacks that, predictably, came with these reviews. Speculation about me, my experience, my motivations, you know the type. Personal things that very often try to divert the attention of the thinness of the arguments proper which are presented. No attention diversions here
