title: "'there are no gods' (23)"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
In this 2nd part, I will deal with the question that Saizai asked me about what I believe today. He asks "What do you think exactly of the gods? Are you sure that no God (x) exists In this case, what degree of certainty do you have?What gods do you refer to? And where does this belief come from? " Well I believe that the god volcano prince Philip does not exist. Some villages on Tanna Island in the South Pacific, believe that Prince Philip, who made a stopover in Vanuatu in the 70s, has achieved their legend according to which the spirit of the volcano 
</p>

<div>
<p>
would take the form of a man with white skin and would travel far in search of a powerful woman. How can they believe in it seriously? We can mount that he is not a deity Their divinity is from Tanna, Prince Philip comes from Corfu. Nowadays, it is easy to remain deaf at this idea of a terre-Ã -terre god The divine conceptions that survived moved God little by little out of reach, mountains, volcanoes or ocean to space and beyond in abstract and metaphysical places at an increasingly large physical and philosophical distance 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
which makes any search for evidence or falsifiability significantly impossible. I will talk about unknown affirmations in the next video But even with these unattainable gods, We can eliminate a large number of concepts as we did with the god Prince Philip And discover fatal contradictions or inconsistencies. For example, the inconsistency that exists between the concept of benevolence and the idea of a hell. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
An infinite compassion cannot approve or tolerate the idea of infinite torture. Likewise, there is a conflict between belief in an immortal being that would at the same time be omnipotent. The concept of omnipotence in itself has aroused debates for centuries between philosophers which offered various paradoxes such as creating a rock that could not be lifted or a square circle, The question being to determine if the paradox came, not from omnipotence, but from the task itself that Mavrodes designates as a "pseudo task". 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But I'm talking about an action that does not contain logical impossibility. Suicide. We, humans, are capable So either the gods can commit suicide, and they are not immortal Either they cannot commit suicide, in which case they are not omnipotent. This combination of characteristics is fatal. No one can bring both. I was told that if an omniscient God is intrinsically immortal So, once again, asking him to commit suicide is contradictory from the point of view of logic even an omnipotent God cannot conflict with his own nature 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
omnipotence is no longer the ability to do everything But the ability to do what is not in conflict with the other properties of this God. The problem is that, according to this definition, I am omnipotent. I can do everything .... ... which does not come into conflict with my other properties. For example, I can't fly without equipment nor breathe underwater Not because I'm not omnipotent But because for me, these things are impossible from the point of view of logic Given my physical and mental capacities. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Asking me to do it is unfair. The words' almighty "seem to make their comeback But this vague expression is not very useful. The biblical story of the Babel Tower constitutes an interesting observation of human omnipotence. It is written that at that time men spoke only a language. They decided to build a city whose tower would reach the heavens. Genesis Chapter 11 verses 5 and 6 says that the biblical god descends and says: " - Behold, they form a single people and all have the same language, and that's what they have undertaken; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Now nothing prevents them from doing everything they have projected. ... " He then thwarts this possibility By confusing languages so that they stop understanding each other. "Nothing would prevent them from doing everything they would have thrown. ..." This is clearly what we can call omnipotence. Divine free will and omniscience are also contradictory. Some suggest that an omniscient being could deliberately restrict his knowledge To preserve his free will. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But restrict knowledge immediately destroyed the concept of omniscience. Others suggest that he knows all the consequences of all possible acts which would leave him free to choose This argument dedicates to failure those who offer a timeless god which perceives the past, the present and the future simultaneously. Those who offer gods that operate within the limits of time sometimes suggest that these gods only know the past and the present And that the future is a mystery ... even for them. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But that contradicts the text that supports their religion.For example in Psalms 139 The verse 4 says: "Because the Word is not on my language, that already, O Lord! You know it entirely." And a little further, in verse 14: "When I was only an informed mass, your eyes saw me; And on your book were all registered on the days which were intended for me, before none of them existed. " In Isaiah 46 verse 10, Yaweh says: "I announce from the beginning what must happen" A passage which announces chapter 48 verse 3: "For a long time I made the first predictions, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They got out of my mouth, and I published them: suddenly I acted, and they got accomplished. " This describes a being who knows not only what could happen, but what will happen And even the active part he will have in this future. It is difficult to maintain that a being who knows, not only the material events, But also our intentions could fail to predict the future. Even if it is generously granted the existence of duality between spirit and matter the two being affected by divine claims What variables remains to keep a little uncertainty? 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
And the omniscience problem does not stop there. Alfred Hitchcock considered the filming of his films as a boring and mechanical exercise, He thought that the creative component of his work stopped with the writing of the storyboard Imagining the course of the film from start to finish. In the same way, an omniscient being carried out the creative part of his work Before even starting its creation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Creation is only a mechanical exercise. Take for example the first three stories of the first part: An omniscient being would have known that Adam and Eve were going to be manipulated by the serpent and would disobey him. Anger should not have been the answer to this event. Anger is the feeling that indicates that something happened that should not have happened. But an omniscient being, who even knows before starting creation, how everything will take place should not feel more anger than we let a brick fall on a plate, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
in accordance with gravity, breaking it. Same thing with the flood. God's disappointment in the face of his creation is impossible. Disappointment is the non -accomplishment of what we hope ... An omniscient being does not hope - he knows. We are told that the angel of the Lord stops the hand of Abraham who will kill his son saying "because I now know that you fear God ..." Now I know ? An omniscient being would have known it all the time. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For the omniscience to be true, the stories must involve a divine surprise, An emotional response or a reassessment of the situation is false. If these stories are true, omniscience does not exist. In all cases, the two are incompatible. It is an aporia.A path that does not lead anywhere. It seems clear that everything that starts with the prefix "omni" leads to a cntbic The affirmation of beings who could do everything, know everything, would be everywhere, would have infinite compassion, etc ... 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
may seem impressive when it is done, When we try to integrate them, especially within a reality full of immorality and suffering These poorly tied up concepts collapse under the weight of their disproportionate ambition. The ultimate in disproportionate ambition could be the idea of perfection. There are many disagreements about the characteristics that a perfect being would have. Some say it would be perfectly empathetic, others that it would be perfectly detached, etc ... 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In any case, perfection poses considerable problems. Matthew Chapter 7 Verse 18 exhibits this succinctly problem: "A good tree cannot bear bad fruits, nor a bad tree carry good fruits." A perfect God creates a perfect human, and imperfection emanates? How can a perfect being sin? We can't just say "because he decided". Why would he do it? What need would it be to do it? The answer: an imperfect need.But where does this imperfect need come from? When you look for the transition point between perfection and imperfection 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The problem is insoluble. Libre or not, being perfect, human or divine, do not make an imperfect choice. Some argue that it is possible that a healthy tree can give bad fruits. But the problem concerns an imperfect revelation. Some say that it is not the revelation of their god that is imperfect But the human error which tarnishes the transmission of the revelation. They only highlight the imperfections of their God, The method unfortunately subject to the errors he has chosen to reveal himself. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Some suggest that there is a great design behind this imperfect revelation. Michael Murray says, for example, that the Judeo-Christian God must remain hidden so as not to observe our moral freedom. His argument is that if we were completely informed of the existence of God We would be forced to adopt a moral attitude, we would have no choice but good. This argument has several flaws: first of all, we report that several characters had direct experience of their god did not hesitate to disobey him. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Cain, for example, spoke directly to God And yet killed his brother. Likewise, the quintessence of evil, Satan in person You can also ask what this moral freedom becomes in paradise becomes. Another argument claims that the revelations are deliberately obscure Because God wants people to have an effort to provide to discover them. But the proliferation of conceptions of God which are equal make the task impossible. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
You are in the middle of nowhere. You are told that the truth is there, somewhere, you only have to look for it. There is an astounding number of panels around you, each claiming to indicate the right path. You choose a direction, or someone has more likely chose it for you, And start walking ... you walk for miles ... but there is no god. Sometimes you meet people who tell you that you have chosen the right direction But are always unable to tell you how far it remains to go. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
After walking a lot, the truth finally begins to appear. Whatever the direction you have taken, You will meet people who will tell you exactly the same thing: The path they indicate is the right one, just continue to walk. Now it is clear that this task is impossible. Your life is limited to a few years And you could spend them all to walk unnecessarily in the same direction. You could waste your time testing other vain directions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Obviously, the time you can devote to each option is divided by their number. It is impossible to investigate each direction with sufficient depth So asking for this depth is akin to an impossible task. What is proposed is a game of pure chance. You can say "my atheism is the refusal to play an impossible game" The argument of the unknown design is often presented as a folding solution, a tote: There is a goal, but we don't know it. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Two remarks: one, the discharge of the design is a double-tranchant weapon: Okay, an unsuitable goal cannot be criticized, it cannot be formulated in any way. But that at the same time destroys the idea that this goal should be benevolent, or morally good. To assert it, this goal should be understood. Those who take refuge behind the argument of the unsuitable goal cannot contradict the arguments Who say that this goal could be perverse, insensitive or sadistic. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Two, even if we do not know what this goal is supposed to be, as I have shown, You can always eliminate unrealizable goals. And that is enough to refute a series of claims concerning the divine. Rather than defending their gods, some prefer to attack the non-believers. Some say that when I was a Christian, God never answered me because I tested him, Or because I was lacking in faith.These two statements are false. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
I didn't need proof, I already believed. I wanted a real relationship.The proof that my faith was absolute It is that I did not believe that it was possible. My detractors also say that God was talking to me, but that I did not hear him. Let's clear things: there is me, entirely receptive and filled with faith There is the Christian God in whom I believed, also eager to have a relationship with me, Knowing exactly how to communicate with me, But who decides instead of speaking to me voluntarily in a way that I cannot hear. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Useless and illogical! It reminds me of these comics where people are explained to themselves things they already know for the benefit of an invisible observer. Here are some of the many contradictory concepts that can be eliminated. I'm talking about contradictory concepts.The concept of a perverse or sadistic God is not contradictory in itself It is only contradictory if other irreconcilable attributes are offered. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
When we dismiss these contradictory concepts, We still have gods who do not want, or cannot, reveal their existence to men And this implies that any system offering a punishment for non -belief is irreparably unfair. I will end up coming back to the question: how sure I am sure that these gods do not exist. The objections I present in this video are based on rational contractions, But there are those who think that even logic and reason are based on divine contingent laws. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This brings us back to the omnipotence. Some, like Guillaume d'Occam, saw omnipotence expressing two ways: "Absolute power" and "power array." If he has absolute power, a god can choose to make any options But once chosen, God orders that power takes over. In other words, everything works according to its rules This allows him not to use his absolute power. By the way, is it not remarkable to see how precise we can be About the actions of the gods. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We must not forget how this information about being supernatural has reached us. Moreover, some say that the way in which we know the logic Reason, justice, morality ... is the way in which the gods have instituted them. Others say that the gods don't even have to worry about contradictions For example, authorizing them to cancel past events as if they had never occurred. As I have already said, the arguments that invoke the unsuitable goal are a double-tranchant weapon Those who campaign against the use of logic and reason, claiming that it depend on the good divine will, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Build a cards castle. First of all, this position creates a paradox by "reasoning" against "reason" The premise is self-destructing. Then, discuss the existence of being intangible, for which there is by definition no physical evidence Without using reason and logic, leaves without any tools to assert the existence of gods. So, how am I sure that none of these contradictory entities exist? I would say that I am sure beyond all reasonable doubts ... 
</p>

<p>
In the last part of this triptych video, I will discuss the claims that I think I am "unknowable"
