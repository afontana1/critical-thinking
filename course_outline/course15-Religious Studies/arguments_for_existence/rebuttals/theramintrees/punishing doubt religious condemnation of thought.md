title: "punishing doubt religious condemnation of thought"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
Doubt is an inevitable part of life for every one of us. We experience doubts about ourselves, about other people and about the ever-changing world around us. Some doubts are easily resolved; with others, resolution might seem unattainable. Some doubts point to significant personal implications for us; with others, the implications seem more abstract. In some cases, we might shy away from investigating our doubts for fear of uncovering realities that seem unbearable. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But generally, we at least feel free to choose whether or not to investigate. But sometimes, other people attempt to block that freedom, condemning the exercise of doubt as dangerous, destructive and disloyal. This practice is observed in dogmatic, authoritarian ideologies. Prime examples are found in the realm of religion. Some Muslim apologists have described doubt as ‘a disease of the heart’ and cite passages in their primary text — the Qur’an — stating that true believers have no doubts. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Some Christian apologists have denounced doubt as a ‘a tool of Satan’ and cite passages in their primary text —&nbsp;the Bible — stating that those who doubt should expect nothing from their god Yahweh. Of course, some theists will protest that they’re completely free to doubt and always have armfuls of questions. Some make themselves out to be quite the irreverent rebel. And if they are genuinely free, good for them. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But look closer and you’ll find that many of these folks aren’t as bold as they like to think. In fact their questions fit very comfortably within a tacitly approved list of commonly voiced complaints that the major religions have all developed stock responses for — however inadequate or platitudinous those responses might be. It’s when you depart from the approved list — and the patience and compassion of those around you turn to disapproval and condemnation — that the fog begins to clear and the limits imposed on your freedom become apparent. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Investigating your religious doubts, in the face of prohibition, can feel like walking an intimidating path. A steep path that might challenge your most deep-rooted preconceptions, your integrity, your stamina. A rocky path, along which you might experience criticism, obstruction and abuse from others. An open-ended path that may — or may not — seem to offer resolution. So why take such a path? That’s what I want to address. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
I want to explore this religious condemnation of doubt, exposing some of the double-standards behind it and the absurdities they lead to, examining the emotional blackmail that leaves some feeling guilty or disloyal for entertaining doubts, and explaining the very real dangers involved when faith is unrestrained by doubt. When Abraham said: ‘Show me, Lord, how you will raise the dead,’ He replied: ‘Have you no faith?’ He said ‘Yes, but just to reassure my heart.’ Allah said, ‘Take four birds, draw them to you, and cut their bodies to pieces. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
‘Scatter them over the mountain-tops, then call them back. ‘They will come swiftly to you. Know that Allah is mighty, wise.’ This strange encounter, described in surah 2, verse 260 of the Qur’an, illustrates a common religious double standard. Whether it be major world religions like Islam and Christianity, or pocket-sized doomsday groups claiming to channel aliens from distant planets, we see the same old division. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
There are the chosen ones, deemed worthy of supernatural proof, and the undeserving hoi polloi, the common masses who are simultaneously denied knowledge but commanded not to doubt — a double-bind that produces acute psychological tensions. Let’s pick apart some of the layers of problems with this elitist system. In ‘Towards Understanding the Qur’an’, Islamic scholar Abul Ala Maududi defends Abraham’s request for a divine demonstration, explaining that Abraham is looking for the ‘inner peace that one attains as a result of direct personal observation’. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is a striking acknowledgement of the inadequacy of faith. Think of it. Here we have Abraham,&nbsp;a religious character so iconic that Islam, Christianity and Judiasm are collected under his name as the Abrahamic religions; a figure who, according to this story, even converses directly with Allah. And still he needs the kind of reassurance that could only come from a demonstration of divine power. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
So, why is he granted the peace of mind that’s denied to ordinary believers? Maududi’s answer is that: ‘.... the kind of function that ordinary believers are required to perform ‘requires of them no more than believing in certain truths without perceiving them through their senses. ‘The function entrusted by [Allah] to the Prophets 'is such that they ought to have direct knowledge of the truths.’ Maududi argues that the prophets had to tell the world they spoke from direct experience, possessing reliable information that set them apart from others who employed conjecture, fancy and imagination. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The problem is, even if their experience was genuine, it would do precisely nothing to set them apart. Imagine six prophets who each claim they’ve been given a guided tour of hell. These could be the hells of established religions like Greek religion, Buddhism, Zoroastrianiasm, or hells as yet unimagined. For argument’s sake, let’s imagine one of them speaks from direct experience. How would you determine which one that was? This is a supernatural realm we’re talking about. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
By definition, it defies all of our experience and frameworks of reference. The fact is we have no criteria for assessing the reliability of this information. Direct experience doesn’t set people apart because the act of recounting a direct experience transforms it into another currency. It now becomes a story, an unsubstantiated claim. This instantly nullifies its evidential value. Nothing is proved by an unsubstantiated claim. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
To restore its value, substantiation is required. But that’s the very thing denied to the common people. Obviously, if you want to play dirty you can get the common people to accept your revelation claims by manipulation rather than substantiation. You just drill it into them, from birth if possible, that your religion is perfect while others are corrupt. You fill their minds with visions of dreamy rewards and nightmarish punishments. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And you make doubt a thought-crime. The end result is generally a pleasingly compliant devotee who’ll swallow all your unsubstantiated claims while scoffing at those of other religions. The problem is while you’re busy manipulating people into your religion other folks are manipulating people into theirs creating followers who’ll favour their revelation stories and become impervious to yours. Which leads us to a deeper problem. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Divine characters like Allah and Yahweh are conceptualised as all-knowing. If they existed, they’d know that people indoctrinated into other religions are generally immune to all but their own religion’s revelation stories. They would therefore also know that to get through to those people in other religions, a much more powerful method of persuasion was needed than revelation stories — ie proof that has the power to transcend all religious biases and barriers. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Proof that has the power to reach every individual. For all the centuries of lip-flapping about all-powerful gods not one single religion has produced the goods. By an astounding coincidence every single one of them has instead required their followers to take their word for it. So, in the absence of proof, what do we have? Here we come the biggest problem so far. Taking just Islam and Christianity, in both cases we have a divine character who’s content to do nothing while millions of human beings, through no fault or desire of their own 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
are indoctrinated into other faiths. It knows that this indoctrination will create powerful biases in those humans immunising them against its religion. It then watches as these humans descend to unspeakable torment in hell as punishment for not believing. What we’re talking about is a holocaust bystander. To describe this behaviour as ‘callous’ limboes beneath understatement. But what I want to highlight is its sheer stupidity. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Imagine the following situation. You’re a night security guard for an apartment block. You’re stationed in a small hut attached to the block with CCTV screens and speaker access to all areas. There’s a fire in the building that forces everyone down to a basement area where they find a red door and a yellow door. They debate which one to take. They can hear traffic noises behind the yellow door. But then someone sees the faded word ‘EXIT’ above the red door. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The group becomes sharply divided into Reds and Yellows each rejecting the arguments of the other. You watch all of this on your CCTV screen, knowing that the red door leads to freedom while the yellow door leads to a dead-end and certain death. There’s a vent next to your desk connected to a vent in the basement. You can see that one of the Reds is standing near it. If you shout down the vent ‘Take the red door’ she’ll just about hear you and she’ll report receiving advice from a disembodied voice. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
You know the Reds are already predisposed to believe her. But you also know the Yellows will easily dismiss this ridiculous ghostly message. Alternatively, you could use the public address system at your disposal to give an announcement over the basement speakers that’ll be clearly heard by everyone identifying yourself as the guard from the security hut and telling them to take the red door. So, do you choose the vent or the PA system? Allah and Yahweh chose the vent. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
I’ve said it before. All-knowing gods should be geniuses. But the ill-conceived system of private revelation employed by prophet-based religions has the grubby fingerprints of limited human thinking all over it. If you want to overcome the doubts of serious thinkers you seriously need to up your game. Many religious people suffer with tremendous guilt about their doubts. — guilt that’s often inspired and reinforced by others In his book ‘God in the dark: The assurance of faith beyond a shadow of doubt’, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Christian author Os Guinness identifies nine kinds of doubt that he suggests lead people out of faith all of which put the blame squarely on the doubter. He talks about doubt from ingratitude, from a faulty view of his god Yahweh, from weak foundations, from lack of commitment,  from lack of growth, from unruly emotion, from hidden conflicts, from inquisitiveness  and from impatience. The possibility that doubt could come from inconsistencies is dogmatically dismissed. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Scare-mongering imagery is used throughout the book. For example, a nameless doubt is compared to a ‘waiting shark’ that ‘lurks below the conscious mind’ with ‘no limit to its shadowy potential for destruction’. Guinness warns that preoccupation with doubt holds ‘much danger’ comparing it to preoccupation with sickness. But preoccupation in both these areas can lead to positive outcomes. With sickness, preoccupation can lead to effective treatments. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
With doubt, preoccupation can expose deception, expand our knowledge and free us from tyranny. Later on, I’ll be talking about the dangers of not doubting and I won’t be resorting to hyperbole, but offering real-life examples. All these criticisms of religious doubters are ones many of us have heard before. The charge of ingratitude was levelled at me when I expressed my own religious doubts as a child. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
I pled — and still plead — not guilty. It wasn’t that I became ungrateful. I was just putting my gratitude where it belonged. For instance, after the recovery of loved ones from life-threatening accidents or illness, while some folks have busied themselves telling everyone about the thanks they gave to their god. you would’ve found me thanking the doctors and nurses. You know? The folks who actually saved those lives, with their knowledge and dedication. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Sometimes a sense of gratitude can be experienced without the need to direct it towards any agent real or imagined. When I’m filling the kettle or standing under the shower, I’m intensely mindful of the fact that access to running water is a tremendous luxury unknown to vast numbers of humans. When I’m sprinting, either to make up time or for the sheer joy of it I feel deep appreciation for the physical mobility I enjoy. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And when I experience doubt —&nbsp;even crushing doubt — I treasure my fundamental freedom to think for myself. For many folks, doubts about their religion get stirred up by distressing life events involving illness, loss, injustice, death. At these times, when many cry out ‘Why, Oh Lord?’ and crave robust answers it seems all religions have to offer is a welter of mimsy platitudes. People are told: ‘God doesn’t give us anything we can’t handle.’ In rebuttal, one word: suicide. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
When people take their own lives to escape some anguish whether that anguish comes from chronic pain, relentless bullying, insufferable loss or an inability to construct a future they have, by definition, been given more than they could handle. People are told: ‘God doesn’t give you the people you want. He gives you the people you need.’ In rebuttal, again one word: pedophile. Is anyone seriously going to argue that their god gave sexually-abused children the paedophiles they needed? Guinness characterises the question ‘Why, Oh Lord?’ as ‘doubt from impatient inquisitiveness’ 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
and puts the doubter’s need to know down to a lack of trust. A damning accusation. But does it stand up? Leaving gods aside, let’s consider our real relationships with other humans specifically, with the people we most trust in the world. When we ask them questions about their actions and intentions, does that mean that we’re impatiently inquisitive, or that we lack trust in them? Of course not. In fact, very often it’s when we trust people most deeply that we feel most confident about approaching them with troubling inconsistencies. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We trust that they’ll understand the genuine concern behind our questions. We trust they’ll be able and willing to clear things up. But most of all we trust that they won’t respond with abuse and emotional blackmail, accusing us of lacking trust. In fact, it’s when people behave in these defensive and attacking ways that alarms bells start ringing. The tragedy isn’t that Christian doubters lack trust,&nbsp;but often that they have so much trust. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Religious apologists might try to whip up all kinds of scare-mongering rhetoric and emotional blackmail to make doubts seem shameful and dangerous. But doubt is a perfectly healthy response when we perceive problems in the information we’re working with and there’s no reason to feel guilty for wanting to address those problems. As for danger, that comes not when we start to doubt, but when we stop doubting. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
HBO’s documentary ‘Mea Maxima Culpa  — Silence in the House of God’ showed how religious suppression of doubt played several key roles in the perpetuation of child sexual abuse by Catholic priests. For some victims, the status of the priest as a divine agent put his motives and actions beyond doubt. They therefore accepted the abuse, figuring they must deserve it. Other victims who did seek help found it was the adults they confided in — from parents to police — who refused to doubt the ‘holy fathers’. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It’s hard for some folks to grasp the height of the pedestal on which the Catholic clergy were placed in these cases. Ordained priests were considered to be transformed into semi-divine humans. One victim of Roman Catholic priest Alexander Walsh reportedly believed he was being touched by the hand of god. Priests are attributed with the divine power of transubstantiation — the purported ability to turn wafers and wine into the body and blood of the Christian messiah Jesus. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In some cases, consecrated wafers were reportedly pressed against the genitals of victims. Priests are also attributed with the power to grant absolution, the forgiveness of mortal sins. Some priests used absolution as divine justification for their crimes claiming they were taking the children’s sins on themselves. Absolution could also be used in a more coercive way, by being withheld if victims didn’t submit. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The church’s aversion to doubt also played a more far-reaching role. In a scandal that alienated countless Catholics, it was discovered that the Vatican had long known about the endemic problem of child sexual abuse within its ranks. Like the Jehovah’s Witnesses a religious organisation that also sees itself as above the reach of worldly laws and has maintained a secret database of known and suspected pedophiles within its membership, the Catholic church also had extensively documented knowledge of offenders which it concealed for years. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Victims might be privately paid off, sworn to secrecy even coerced into signing official apologies for the true allegations made against their abusers under threat of excommunication. Why? To preserve unquestioning trust in the church. To suppress doubt. Some apologists assert that Yahweh has nothing to do with this unholy mess; that these are human acts for which he’s unaccountable. But Yahweh isn’t so easily absolved. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We come back to elitism. According to the Bible, Jesus chose to spread his word not through an egalitarian system of universal revelation to every individual, but through an elitist system of specially appointed agents called disciples. The Catholic clergy — from priest to bishop to pope — continues this legacy of discipleship. In Luke 10 verse 16, Jesus tells the disciples: ‘Whoever listens to you listens to me’. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
More pointedly he continues: ‘.... whoever rejects you rejects me’. And just to really drive the point home, he adds that whoever rejects him rejects Yahweh. So, cutting out the middle Messiah, reject Yahweh’s disciples and you reject Yahweh. By introducing this system of elite disciples that the common people are directed to trust as Yahweh’s representatives, Yahweh becomes implicated in any abuses that result from the misuse of that trust. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And as an all-knowing god, able to foresee every abuse that would result from this elitist system he has no escape hatch. If he existed, he would absolutely be accountable. Child sexual abuse occurs in all kinds of institutions. But the religious suppression of doubt has given priests a level of immunity other sexual predators could only dream of allowing some to prey on hundreds of children over decades under the protection of a church more concerned with its holy reputation than the suffering of its victims. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Guinness conceptualised a nameless doubt as a ‘waiting shark’ with ‘no limit to its shadowy potential for destruction’. But doubt isn’t the shark. Doubt is what allows us to spot the sharks around us: the deceivers, the manipulators and the abusers who thrive in spaces that suppress doubt. Doubt can sometimes put us in a spin. But lack of doubt leaves us vulnerable to the spin of others. The hollow metaphors, the deflections, the doublespeak and the emotional blackmail of those who wish to forcibly confine us in their ideology 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
rather than try to persuade us respectfully. Doubt is the the path out of that confinement. Ideologies that demand their followers neither know nor doubt put those followers in an impossible psychological position, denying them both certainty and uncertainty. Sadly, there are still many parts of the world where voicing doubts will attract officially condoned punishments up to and including execution. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They might silence some of our mouths, but we should never let them silence our minds. ‘To find yourself, think for yourself’ This quote, attributed to Socrates, reminds us that when we allow others to think for us what we’ll find in our heads are their ideas, their perceptions, their experiences, their beliefs in place of our own. To find ourselves, we need to exercise our freedom to think and resist ideologies that try to block that freedom by punishing doubt. 
</p>
