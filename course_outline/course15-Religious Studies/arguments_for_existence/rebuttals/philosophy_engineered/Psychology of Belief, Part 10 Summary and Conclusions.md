Psychology of beliefs, part 10: Generalization and conclusion -So, for the observer, at rest, moving light watches are perceived by the walking slower, in proportion to the gamma factor. The ruler or something else in the movement also looks abbreviated in proportion to the same factor. In a strange arithmetic of relativity, it does not matter how you look at this when one speed is added to another, the result is always less than the speed of light.

Henry, a twin who flew away and then returned, was only old for a few months. But Albert, a twin who did not change the inertial system, was old for 20 years. Slow down time, reduction of length, relativity of simultaneousness, none of these phenomena are manifested in our daily experience, And many of them absolutely contradict our fundamental intuition. So how does physicists get away with all this egregious nonsense, and why do they not encounter crowds of skeptics exposing this nonsense? Consider the following experiment. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Take a couple of cesium atomic hours and synchronize them. Now put them nearby on the table and wait 24 hours. Upon completion, compare them.How much did they disperse in the day? The answer is very amazing. These devices are so accurate in counting time that the average discrepancy between them can reach less than one nanosecond per day. Now let's change the conditions a little. Take a couple more cesium atomic hours and place them on commercial aircraft. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Raise every hour by 50,000 feet and fly around the world. Send some hours to the east, and others to the west. Upon completion, compare synchronization between traveling and motionless hours. Of course, a simple act of raising and moving the clock will have no effect on their synchronization, right? Wrong!No matter how strange it sounds, the clock traveling east has actually lost about 60 nanoseconds of time, And the clock that traveled to the West gained almost 270 nanoseconds. 
</p>
</div>

What is even more interesting, exactly the same distortion of time was predicted mathematically, through the equations of Einstein's theory of relativity. Gravity and movement really change the flow of time, and we can measure this effect directly. Therefore, it does not matter how ridiculous and contributively this can be felt, we have no choice but to accept that this is a real feature of nature. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Physicists really do not invent all this. Well, how does this relate to the issues of faith? Think about many extraordinary statements of religious organizations. For example, one particularly popular idea is associated with the “power of prayer”. Among the countless religious organizations, there is a widespread belief that prayer has the power to generate stunning results as mountain movement and healing of diseases. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But what attempts do religious believers make to convince us of these statements? Can they in this way demonstrate the reliability of such fantastic phenomena? Consider the following experiment. Find a group of hospital patients undergoing cardiac bypass. Although such an operation is considered very routine by modern standards, postoperative complications are still very common events. Therefore, it is not surprising that as many as 50% of patients are reported to any complications within 30 days after surgery. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Now let's change the conditions a little. Find the second group of patients undergoing the same operation. But this time, get together with your favorite Christian denominations and regularly pray for the health and speedy restoration of your group. After 30 days, compare the level of postoperative complications between groups. Of course, the merciful deity of Christianity will more than joy show its divine power, through the sudden recovery of its suffering children, right? Unfortunately, it is wrong!Of all the studies conducted by the effects of intercessor prayer, no one has yet provided significant, reproducible results. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Prayer simply does not work as it is advertised. So what can we understand from these simple demonstrations?Is there any at least some supernatural beliefs with the demonstrated, reproducible effect on our tangible reality? What really happens in the world of religion and faith? Throughout these videos, we investigated statements made by professional apologists, popular evangelists, spiritual authorities and ordinary lay people. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We saw complex philosophical arguments, emotionally charged calls and sincere personal evidence. But in our entire search, which we have not yet seen - these are basic empirical evidence! Even in those rare cases when a religious dogma allows you to dissect yourself with an experimental test, observation always in the end refutes the application. All spiritual beliefs in the best case are empirically groundless, or at worst - demonstrated erroneous. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
So far this situation does not change, we are intellectually obligated to operate with an indicative conclusion that religious beliefs are absolutely aligned with reality. There is no God, there is no afterlife, and there are no miracles. At least it should be obvious.Without calculated observations and experiments to justify our understanding, There is no functional difference between ideas that truly reflect reality, and ideas that are invented from an empty place. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Anyone who, at least to the slightest degree, practices a rational study, will very quickly come to the exactly the same conclusion. But if this is all that is required for this, then why are there so many believers so far? Why does the world are teeming with literally billions of Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus and many others? This is an observation that strongly requires an explanation. Look carefully at this block diagram.Perhaps this is not the most stringent scientific presentation, but she still talks about a very serious problem. 
</p>
</div>

<p>
Each of these arrows is a psychological mechanism through which the idea can be invented from pure imagination, and then implanted into the human brain with statistical reliability. Each of these arrows was empirically demonstrated and reproduced in controlled laboratory conditions. And, as we illustrated throughout these videos, absolutely each of them is openly operated by religious believers in an attempt to convince us of any spiritual ideas. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But unfortunately, this is not even half of them!We can easily continue it for hours. This scheme is only the top of the colossal psychological iceberg! We have not even touched on topics such as “Brush of Knowledge Red Labor”, “Bathing in the reflected rays of glory”, “Dunning-Crouping effect”, “Barnum effect”, “group thinking”, “stereotyping”, “the effect of false consensus”, “effect of acquaintance with the object”, “placebo effect”. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The list can be continued and continued. You can get a valuable lesson from this confusing pile of psychological spaghetti. The pressure of the environment and social indoctrination have much more influence on our solutions than even the most logically verified arguments. With proper psychological stimulation, even our memory and sensory perception itself can be easily distorted. We, human beings, are not even closely smart and rational as we arrogantly consider ourselves. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

This simplest fact speaks of religion much more than any philosophical debate will ever be able to. Religious beliefs are not only empirically unfounded, but we also have a set of completely natural mechanisms through which spiritual beliefs can be generated initially. And what is the most exportive, we have documented examples of how religious apologists of all stripes willingly exploit these same mechanisms in their attempts to spread their beliefs. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The supposedly pious gods who seek to spread what they consider truth resort to instruments that, as we know, have the power to generate beliefs in general in anything! This, first of all, is the main crime against humanity committed by religion. The very tools of science through which we build practical confidence in the true state of reality, and religions do everything possible to evade them. Some even reach their demonization. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The very cognitive failures that distort our judgments and deform our perception itself, and religions do everything possible to exploit them, even support them! Truth simply is of less importance for religion than conviction and conformism. But, despite all this, it is important to realize that religion is not the main problem. Religion is only a symptom.The true fundamental problem is ourselves. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is a natural human tendency to generate strong conviction in the complete absence of strict empirical evidence. This is the original ignorance of our own vulnerabilities, and the subsequent inability to apply correct scientific methods when we strive for knowledge. This is our persistent resistance to a change in our opinion and recognition of errors, even in a collision with an avalanche of evidence of the opposite. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This, as I believe, is primarily the rest, is a source of all our problems. This is the reason why we have ridiculous theories of conspiracy, anti -vaccinating, psychics, ufology, Creationism, astrology, homeopathy and any other stubborn superstition that continues to impede human progress. So how can we overcome our natural human predispositions to psychological distortions?It is possible that there is no simple answer to this. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We are dealing with the all -encompassing social and biological infrastructure of ignorance, lightness and distortion of perception. Currently, apparently, the only obvious solution to this problem is to continue the multiplication of our efforts in scientific education and rational skepticism. Especially when it comes to children. Only through the study and awareness of our vulnerabilities of intuition and perception can we take measures to counteract them. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is the main essence of the scientific method. This is the best and only tool that we have to cover the darkness of superstitions with the light of knowledge. - On our little planet, at this very moment, we are faced with the most important in history. What we will do with our world right now will be widespread into the depths of centuries and fundamentally affect the fate of our descendants. This is absolutely in our power to destroy our civilization and, possibly, our entire species. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If we surrender to superstitions, greed and stupidity, then we can immerse our world in darkness, deeper than the times between the collapse of classical civilization and the Italian Renaissance. But we are also able to use our empathy and our intelligence, our technology and our wealth, to make the life of every inhabitant of this planet a prosperous and meaningful, In order to incredibly expand our understanding of the universe and lead us to the stars.
