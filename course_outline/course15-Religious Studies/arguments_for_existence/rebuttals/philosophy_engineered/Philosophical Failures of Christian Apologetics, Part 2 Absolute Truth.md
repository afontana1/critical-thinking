Philosophical failures of Christian apologetics, part 2: Absolute Truth So what do we know, real?I mean "really know." Well, I don’t know how you, but, as far as I can judge, I am obviously a reasonable agent experiencing a constant stream of sensory information. I don’t know where this information comes from and what “absolute”, “deep” reality that determines it can be, but this is just the limit on which I am stuck. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
I can be a full -fledged person in the real physical world, but I can just be a brain in a bank connected to the matrix. I just don’t know this, and moreover, I can’t find out at all. No observation or deduction volumes will never be able to truly allow to distinguish these philosophical possibilities. This is what “skepticism in relation to the outside world” does one of the largest pains in the lower back of the philosophers to this day. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But even with such a fundamental restriction on knowledge, this continuous stream of information still has obvious patterns and correlations, And I would like to try to somehow comprehend them. It is not so easy to answer this challenge, and to this day many philosophers constantly argue about what exactly means to be “true”. In part, this confusion is caused by the fact that the “truth” itself can be represented in many different categories. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, one of the most basic categories is just “truth by definition”, as a classic statement that “all bachelors are not married.” This, in essence, is “100% accurate” in all practical meanings, but only because the word “bachelor” in this context was literally defined as “an unmarried man”. Therefore, the statement that all bachelors are not married is no more significant and informative than the statement that "all unmarried men are not married" - This is a tautology.The reason why the word “bachelor” generally exists is that it serve as an encapsulation of a complex series of syllables and ideas, thereby saving time and energy during communication. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The only real measure of the “true” definition statement is whether other people can agree with him and successfully communicate through it. This example also illustrates the key role that language plays in epistemology. Because it is important to understand that if you really get to the bottom of the bottom: almost everything that we can ever call “truth”, ultimately exists only in the form of a linguistic set of sounds spilled into the air. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is because the language is the main tool with which we communicate, form ideas and generate a coherent course of thoughts. Therefore, “truth” is just a label that we assign to these thoughts in accordance with some arbitrary set of rules. The main goal of epistemology is to then establish what rules we must use in assessing the final “truth” of a particular statement. For example, consider such a phrase as "stand red, step on green." Such phrases are called axiomatic statements and are a declaration of rules that need to be followed in order to engage in certain activities. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Axioms are “true” by default, just as long as they give agreed results, and people again agree to follow them. This may seem somewhat banal at first glance, until you realize that the entire area of mathematics is purely axiomatic in nature - This is a set of invented rules based on operations and relations between elementary abstractions inside arbitrarily defined sets. Even deductive logic is the same: axiomatic rules designed to formalize our ability to sort information and evaluate the final “truth” of various judgments. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Thus, although countless particularly gifted philosophers love to wave “absolute truth” in the phrase such as “2+2 = 4”, They almost always lose sight of the fact that this is simply the application of arbitrary rules to achieve the corresponding conclusions. They have no idea that the same principles are equally well applicable to the seedlings, poker and chess, also with a work of clean, 100%accuracy. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But what about other forms of judgments, such as the phrase “I see red”? In the end, I may not know what red is, how it works, what causes it or what chain of events occurs after photons fall on my retina. But this does not matter, because I definitely experience a special sensory perception, which is unique among many others. The very word “red” is just a label that I stick to experience to distinguish it from other similar experiences. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The observant judgments of this form are called “incorrigible” and again they are “100% true” simply because they are made. The only requirement is that the person who declares this is honest and again use the standard terminology that others can understand. Even the expression “I think, therefore, I exist” is just a combination of sensory experience in combination with linguistic agreements and axiomatic statements. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, “I think” is an incorrigible statement that hangs a label for a distinct experience of experience itself. “I exist” is a basic verb, which we can arbitrarily determine in such a way that “things that think must exist.” “Therefore, I exist” is, finally, the deductive statement used to communicate observation with its definition in accordance with the axiomatic rules of the theory of sets. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Voila!You have just proved the most famous Descartes theorem with full, 100%accuracy.Just "amazing." Now let's complicate the situation a little and consider such a phrase as “all bananas grow on the trees” or, possibly, “all bachelors are bald.” Such phrases are often called “synthetic judgments”, and they represent descriptive statements about the deep nature of external reality. But what are the rules now?How exactly should we measure the truth of these phrases, when there is a fundamental gap between reality, our perception of reality and our linguistic framework to describe reality? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is the moment when philosophers begin to fit strongly with each other, but the key idea is often overlooked in the process. Namely, that “truth” is just a word, and therefore it can be determined by any arbitrary metric that we want. For example, it is possible that I want to measure judgments by their ability to give me a sense of comfort and significance. I could believe that chocolate burns fat or that the squirrels invented the moon, and this would be completely justified, because these beliefs satisfy my definition of truth. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Or even better, I could define the truth as everything that coincides with the authority, for example, with the dictate of the prophet or the texts of the Holy Scriptures. I could believe that the Earth was created in six days or that the indigenous Americans are really descendants of Jewish migrants, And again, I would be completely justified in this, because this is precisely what my definition of truth requires. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But let's look in the eye.These definitions are completely arbitrary and useless, because they ignore the fundamental aspect of beliefs. The reason that any of us “believes” or “is convinced” of something in general is that we can ultimately use this information as a guide for our actions. That is why, sooner or later, everyone should begin to measure the truth of conviction by his ability to help us make decisions with the expectation of the desired results. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Thus, decisions based on “true” beliefs will appear in the form of a controlled, predictable experience, While decisions based on “false” beliefs will ultimately fail in achieving this goal. Of course, this is a rough, pragmatic view of the truth, but it is also the only one that has any functional connection with the real world. That is why science can be very accurately described as a formalized methodology for explaining and predicting events. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And she works fine!No other methodology in the history of human thought has never been close to what science could offer. But who knows?Maybe there is something better.Maybe if I scratch my nose, I will pray to Buddha and make a desire for a star, then I can surpass the scientific method in the formation of future events. But remember, if I can’t ultimately treat diseases, create the Internet and send people into space, then everyone will spit on my epistemological methodology. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is the only, simple principle on which Christian apologetics invariably suffers more than anywhere else. Because the statement that something like God “exists” is literally the assertion that somewhere, in some way, I can interact with him at the physical level and generate predictable sensory experience. This is the statement that if I stick a stick in the right place, then something will poke back. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
So, let's feel generous and decide to agree with the whole Christian religion without a doubt.And then what?What will change? What experiments can we conduct to check this?What demonstrative power can this god give? What decisions can I now make in the real world with real consequences that will manifest itself through the idea that somewhere there is a powerful incorporeal agent? Contrary to the selfless thinking of Christians, this is precisely the final criteria of “truth” when descriptive statements about reality are made, and not how well you can formulate lovely small arguments. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Now keep in mind that this is only a small selection of many categories of linguistic judgments that can be made, and each with its own set of well -established rules by which you can measure truth. But it is also important to understand that these rules are absolutely arbitrary. It’s like standing in a room with two buckets, one of which says “Truth”, and on the other - “False”. If someone puts a piece of paper in your hand with some letters, how do you determine which bucket to leave it? Maybe you want these shortcuts to have a functional importance regarding your decision -making in real life, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Or maybe you just don't care, and you just think that all the judgments go to the “false” bucket, no matter what. Maybe you think that epistemology has a greater sense if we turn on the third bucket, or even the fourth, or possibly a whole continuum of the bucket. And yet, no matter how we determine this system, nothing physically makes us agree with the statement that all bachelors are not married. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If our goal is to effectively communicate with each other through English, then this can help if we accept this agreement. However, if such goals do not matter to us, then we do not lose anything, rejecting this idea. In the same way, no one is obliged to accept the pragmatic scientific method. But if our goal is to create a functional base of knowledge capable of forming future events, then science is a methodology that seems to work damn well. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, the next time, when some particularly gifted philosopher tries to ask you if there is an “absolute truth”, then the answer is obviously not. Because it is one thing when the individual is “absolutely confident” in any judgment in accordance with clearly defined rules, But it’s completely different when this confidence overcomes all the time and space through all linguistic and cultural barriers. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
“Truth” is not some kind of physical nature, but simply a label given by ideas in accordance with fictional goals. No judgment can never be “absolute” in this sense, because no epistemological system imposes on us the universal duty to always call this judgment “true”. Absolute truth, therefore, absolutely does not exist. [Translated vk.com/id79920293]
