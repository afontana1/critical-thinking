title: "The Idolatry of the Bibleâ€”Why Biblical Inerrantism is Impossibly Wrong"

- We believe that the God who created the universe is able to write a book. And God, who is ideal, is able to write an ideal book. - And this is what confirms the doctrine of infallibility that the Bible is true in everything that it teaches. - That this is the final and absolute freedom in full from any mistakes of any kind, in general. -God-father cannot be mistaken, the Bible is the Word of God, therefore, the Bible cannot be mistaken. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
- In all things that they confirm and deny, they are absolutely true, because these are the words of God. - If the biblical infallibility is incorrect, then God is not God. Biblical infallibility.The doctrine that the Bible is an inspired, infallible and absolutely true word of God. This is a really popular belief among mainstream Christian denominations. But you ever wondered what this doctrine specifies specifically? Because when we listen to popular Christian authorities, they draw such a picture that God himself takes a pen and scribbles the words with his bare hands. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It is as if God personally prescribes letters on some holy parchment with gold ink before passing it to the world. How else we must interpret this idea that God is supposedly the author of the Holy Scriptures, or the Scripture itself is “inspired” by God. Reality, of course, is completely different.We know that God could absolutely not write the Bible with his own hands, because the Bible itself openly calls human authors. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is right here in the headings in half of her books.The gospel from Matthew, the Epistles of Paul to the Romans, Solomon's song, the book of Isaiah, all human authors. Even when books do not declare their authors openly, at least it is well clear that these people initially recorded these words. Therefore, when Christians constantly describe the Bible as a “word of God”, I usually perplex - In what specific way did the words of people receive a promotion to the words of God? In general terms, the most popular look, apparently, is that, although God did not write the Bible physically with his own hands, he still “revealed” the Bible through his prophets. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, in the book “To Galatians”, Paul tells us that he received all this information not from simple human sources, but through the divine revelation from Jesus Christ. And since Jesus and God are one, then any revelation from Jesus, in fact, is a revelation from God. In the same way, the four gospels do not make a statement that they were written personally by Jesus, and these are just from second -hand reports that Jesus allegedly spoke and did. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Some books do not at all make specific references to their sources, but it is supposed to come from God. This is an absolutely legitimate interpretation that many Christians willingly accept, But maybe we will spend a second to realize what really happens here? When you read a specific excerpt from the Bible, you are not dealing with the “word of God” in any literal sense. In the best case, what you really get, this is the word of a person who simply claims what he says on behalf of God. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And maybe for you this state of affairs is absolutely comfortable.Maybe God really spoke with the Apostle Paul and others. Therefore, the Bible, in all practical relations, is the "word of God." However, I hope you forgive me, because I am still in a slight bewilderment. When we say that the Bible is the “Word of God”, are we talking about the literal transcript of specific words spoken by God to our prophets? Not really!This is far from the case!The Bible was not completely clearly supposed to serve as a literal recording of divine speech, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And there are even a few examples when the authors openly speak from their own name, and not God. The Bible, therefore, absolutely cannot represent the “Word of God” in its entirety, because people definitely talk a lot in it. Nevertheless, only because these words are not in a clear way of God, it does not mean that God is completely absent. Maybe the authors simply make an overview of what God says.Or maybe he simply “inspires” them with the right words. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Again, this is completely normal if you want to believe in it, and many Christians recognize this this during a detailed question. But of course, that's all?Yes? God inspires His prophets, the prophets write a concise generalization for the rest of us, And there are no intermediate steps in this process? Well, not quite.For example, according to the Gospel of Luke, we actually have no first-hand reports about anything that Jesus allegedly said. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Instead, we have a set of second -hand reports, which were allegedly “handed over to us by eyewitnesses and ministers of the word from the very beginning.” Moreover, although the other three gospels do not say it directly, it is at least convincingly traced that the authors are not eyewitnesses. None of the intermediate sources are even identified, which leaves us in perfect ignorance of who these people were. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We have no idea how many people were interviewed, what process of verification was used in their selection, and how much they were distant from original events. Let's not forget that these alleged sources are still not quite modern events described. For example, many Bible researchers agree that Mark's book was not recorded at least 30 years after the death of Christ, And that the other three gospels were almost accurately recorded even later. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, every time you read the story of Jesus and his ministry, it is important to realize that you are not dealing with the “word of God” through some prophet. At best, what you really get, this is the word of a guy who simply claimed that he knew another guy who heard from another guy, Which is absolutely swearing that he was there decades ago, when Jesus did all his affairs. Keep in your head that none of the voiced is especially controversial, given that the Bible itself is the main source of this information. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But let's ignore all this, and still, let's say that everything written by biblical authors is an inspired, infallible, perfectly true word of God. Can anyone now tell me, specifically where I can find the original manuscript so that I can read it myself? Yes, about this ... Did we forget to mention that none of the original manuscripts survived? The printing press was not invented before the 15th century, which means that absolutely every copy of absolutely every page of absolutely every Bible should have been written by hand. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Paper manuscripts also have an unpleasant feature to decompose over time, What does it mean that all the original letters, including their copies, have been rotten for a long time. Therefore, every time we talk about a specific book from the Bible, we do not definitely talk about original letters of original authors. In the best case, we can meaningfully talk about copies from copies, from copies, from copies, which eventually reached us today. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Of course, we can trust all these ancient letters that they perfectly preserved the original formulations of biblical authors?Right? No!This is far from the case! Ancient letters are sadly known for the presence of errors, and there are countless documented examples of this, scattered through the surviving manuscripts. And these are also not necessarily harmless typos.And deliberate changes with significant theological consequences! One of the most egregious examples of this phenomenon is the so -called “pericope adultrae” (Christ and sinner), found in the book of John. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Or, depending on what ancient manuscript you read, not found in the book of John! This is a famous story about Jesus and a woman “taken in adultery”, and all this is nothing more than a frankly new text. We have many surviving copies of John, dating back to the beginning of the third century, And this whole story is glaring in the early texts. Even the names of the gospels are well -known text innovations. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Nowhere in older Greek manuscripts you will never find anything that says or implies the Gospel, according to ... Matthew, Mark, Luke or John. ” Christian scribes deliberately added these names for centuries later, because they wanted to give authoritative names for anonymous reports. That is why many Christian organizations tend to limit the doctrine of “infallibility” only to original scriptures. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is also strange, because at a certain fundamental level they should be aware of what theological snowball follows this. There are simply no surviving scriptures that you can refer to, which means that any attempt to reconstruct the original text will certainly be ordinary guessing. But let's imagine again that we are generous today, and just announce that all this is completely not a problem. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The Bible is an inspired, infallible word of God, preserved with absolute accuracy for countless centuries, Just as the original authors conceived, and it was written specifically for us today in modern American English. No.It's stupid.The Bible was not written in American English, but on Koyne (common Greek) and in Hebrew! Both have long been “dead” languages that none of the living people have ever heard the pronounced live. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Every time you read the modern English translation of the Bible, you read this - translation! At some point in history, a person had to physically take an ancient manuscript in his hands and carefully translate this document into our native languages. But as is known to anyone who has experience of translation, it is fundamentally impossible to perfectly maintain meaning when translating ideas from one language to another. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That is why there are so many different versions of the Bible in general. There is no objectively correct way of interpreting the language, which means that in the end you should just choose what kind of translation of the Bible you want to read. Is this the Bible of King Jacob?American standard Bible?General English Bible?New International Bible?English standard Bible? Until you have free knowledge of several ancient languages, Then you will have to rely on the works of error human creatures without options when you read the English translation of the Bible. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
What is even more wearing, many original Greek copies of the New Testament are already translations on their own! Remember that Jesus allegedly carried his ministry among the poor illiterate peasants of ancient Palestine, And this means that any words that he physically pronounced aloud were necessarily Aramaic. Greek was not the language of poor illiterate peasants, but rich educated elites. That is, we must overcome more than one language barrier, but two language barriers!The first of which is now forever and hopelessly lost! 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But hey!Maybe all this is also not important for you!Maybe you believe that God perfectly retained any slightest detail of the central doctrines through the entire history of the Bible so that we will receive this news today. Everything, from being and judges, to the gospels and messages - perfectly inspired scripture.Right? And let's not forget my loved ones personally: the book of Wisdom Solomon, the book of Tovita and the book of Judith. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Wait a second, you want to tell me that these last three books are no longer an infallible and inspired word of God? And who decided so?Protestants?This is strange, because Catholics tell me the exact opposite! Well, let's decide this once and for all.Who can tell me at what moment in history God personally went down to earth And he revealed what biblical documents are officially inspired by the Holy Scriptures, and which are simply sinful inventions of human authors? Oh, for sure, this has never happened!The task of arbitrary choice, what book to include in the Bible was not a matter of divine revelation; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
People did it!Enjoyed people are those who digged up in all ancient manuscripts before deciding which to leave and which to be thrown away. It was definitely a difficult task, because the fakes were a really common problem among ancient Christians. For example, in the “2nd Thessalonians” Chapter 2, Paul himself openly warns of the existence of false letters on his own behalf. This is still paradoxical, because modern researchers are convinced that specifically this letter was very likely to be a fake itself. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
So what criteria the ancient theologians in principle could apply, which would guarantee the perfect infallible selection of scriptures, With abundance of text variations, alternative theologies and even frank fakes?! Let's clarify.It is one thing to believe that God “inspired” the Bible, in some streamlined, metaphorical sense. But a completely different thing to describe the Bible as some kind of impeccably divine relic. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We are talking about a book that was written by people, often these are surveys of the memoirs of other people, And then it was translated by people, edited by people, modified by people, Summarized by people, copied by people, preserved by people, again translated by people, and then compiled by people, And in order to finally eventually be elevated people to the absolutely infallible “Word of God”! All this is not only flagrantly dishonest, but this offers the work of error mortal people to the status of divine perfection. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For this there is a word in Christian theology, friends.This is called "idolatry."And this is a terrible mortal sin. [Translated vk.com/id79920293]
