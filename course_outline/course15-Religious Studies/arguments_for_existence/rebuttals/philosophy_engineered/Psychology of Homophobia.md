title: "Psychology of Homophobia"

- We decided that the Bible is the word of God. We do not need to arrange any debate about what we believe in, everything is already written in the Bible. It's clear?Therefore, we do not need to argue that we should think about homosexual activity, everything is written about this in the Bible! This is Ted Haggard, the American Gospel Pastor, the founder of the New Life Church and the ardent defender of "traditional family values" How paradoxical it turns out that in 2006 the pastor Ted turned out to be involved in a loud sexual scandal with the use of methamphetamine and male prostitution.

And this is Mark Foli, a former official representative of Florida, a proud member of the Roman Catholic Church and a fierce opponent of homosexual rights. And again, how paradoxical that this gentleman was forced to quit Congress after the scandal of sexual harassment to minor young men who worked in Congress. But this is Larry's “wide pose” Craig, a congressman, a Christian-methodologist and another political activist against gay rights. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
How paradoxical it is that this person pleaded guilty of accusations of obscene behavior after sexual harassment to a police officer under the cover of the airport in the toilet. You know, at such moments, I recall a well -known expression: if this happens once, this is an anomaly.If this happens twice, this is a coincidence.But if this happens three times, then this is a pattern. So why are ardent opponents of gay rights constantly come across these loud gay scandals? Does science have any considerations on this issue?Maybe there is a connection between homophobia and latent homosexuality? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Consider the following experiment. Type of a group of heterosexual men aged 18 to 31 and measure their indicators on the scale of homophobia. There is nothing complicated here, it is just a numerical indicator determined by answers to 25 questions. For example, on a scale from 1 to 5, how much do you agree with the statement: I will feel comfortable, working next to a man homosexual. Or maybe: I will be disappointed if I find out that my child is homosexual.Etc. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Upon completion, divide the subjects into two groups.Those who have scored more than 50 points will be considered homophobic, And those who have scored less than 50 points will be considered like non -brothel. Now the most interesting.Place each subject in a cozy soft chair in a private soundproof room. When the subject on the spot, show him a 4-minute video with the most juicy and sexual pornography M+F, to which your dirty hands reached. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And when the subject relaxes and enjoys the show, measure the increase in his penis throughout the video. Some of you can be surprised how it is generally possible to measure the increase in the penis? This is a completely understandable question.There will be no laboratory assistant to sit there with a ruler when an erection has an erection? It turns out that the answer is very simple. All you need is a mercury-razin meter of a circle, also known as a PLASMOGRABIC for a penis, Or, as I like to call him, a riser! 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Yes, medical science really has similar tools. Of course, it is very interesting how the conversation looked when the researchers tried to convince the subjects to put on this thing. When you finish the collection of data about the erection from the risers, ask yourself: Will homophobia have any effect on the pleasure of good M+f pornography in men?Of course not, right? If you thought so, then you are absolutely right. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
As the schedule clearly shows, the difference in the diameter of the penis in each group was almost insignificant. Homophobes and non -brothels enjoyed classical pornography the same.Who would have thought? Now let's change the conditions a little. After the first round of scientific viewing of porn, give your subjects for several minutes to cool and prepare for the second round. This time turn on them the next 4-minute video of good, high-quality porn. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Only this time, instead of ordinary heterosexual sex, show them the best lesbian sex that is in the adult industry market. Again, with the help of a riser, do not forget to measure the erection of the penis from your subjects. Now we will ask ourselves again: will homophobia have any effect on the pleasure of homosexual w+f pornography in men?Of course it will be, right? Not really!As far as the erection testifies, homophobic men enjoy the f+sex, like any other man. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, there is also no difference here. Now let's change the conditions for the last time. At the end of the second round, give the subject a break to cool before the third round. And this time show them a video with homosexual m+m pornography. Of course, homophobic men who literally feel uncomfortable in the physical presence of other male geys will not show any excitement from such a stimulus, right? Wrong!As the results clearly show, homophobic men tend to demonstrate the diameter of an erection twice as much than non -fomersault men, watching m+m pornography.

These results have been reproduced many times in the scientific literature. The more fierce a person opposes homosexuals, the more likely it is that he himself covers latent homosexual arousal. This is a phenomenon that I like to call Ted Haggard syndrome. The more his lips say “no”, the more likely it is that his loins will say “yes”. Therefore, when the next time you will see the next of these not quite sane religious guys protesting against the nightmare of same -sex marriages, ask yourself:
