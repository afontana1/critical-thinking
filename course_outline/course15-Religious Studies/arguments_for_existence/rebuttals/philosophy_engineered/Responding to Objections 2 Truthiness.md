title: "Responding to Objections 2 Truthiness"

<br>

<div>
<p>
Hi all.This will be a continuation of our auxiliary videos to the "philosophical failure of Christian apologetics." And today we will consider some of the most basic principles of epistemology, with a special emphasis on definitions. Because, honestly, I saw too many naive delusions about what specifically means the idea of “truth”. And it turns out that if people are not in the material at this level of discussion, then the rest is generally insignificant. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That is, if we cannot agree on what specifically means “truth” (truth), then it is simply not initially that it makes no sense to try to argue, which is truly and not true. As I said earlier, the discussion about the existence of God is something more than an ordinary academic dispute. But in reality, this is a philosophical battle for the rules of epistemology themselves. If you can pervert in people a fundamental understanding of the meaning of the word “truth”, then after that it becomes very easy to convince them of the reality of all kinds of crazy delirium. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That is why it is so important that we get to the bottom of the most important foundation of the very concept of “knowledge”, and build a good, reliable and functional understanding of epistemology. This means that we must seriously stop and ask ourselves: what does the word "truth" mean?And especially what it does not mean? To see where the problem comes from, let's start with a simple question: what is truth? And I think most of us have an approximate idea of the meaning of the word, and usually it sounds in this way: 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Truth is what corresponds to reality. This is called the "theory of conformity of truth."For example, if I say that I live in North America, and if I really live in a place called North America, then we will say that my statement is true.Or we can say: this is the truth that I live in North America. This fits very well in our natural intuition about the world, and this is normal. But there is a clear problem that people tend to not notice when they use such a definition. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And this is the problem: how can I objectively define whether or not some kind of affirmation of real reality is or not? Seriously, this is a very important question, because it is possible that I lied to you, and I record this discussion from Europe.Or maybe I'm on the moon?And you cannot prove that this is not so, right? Or maybe there is no North America at all, because you really are in the transcendental world of illusions outside of space and time?Or maybe you are just a brain in a bank connected to the matrix? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, it does not matter how the true state of things is, there is always a place for some philosophical doubt. The thing that we need to solve this issue with absolute reliability is the very thing for which we do not have direct perception at all. Remember that this is the basic "problem of skepticism in relation to the outside world." That is, there really may be a certain objective external reality, there, outside our sensors, but the real fact that we cannot know it. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We cannot ignore this huge philosophical barrier that exists between reality, our perceptions of reality, and our linguistic system to describe reality. Therefore, to say that the truth corresponds to reality is actually to say that truth can never be known with any objective reliability. Therefore, the first thing I want to argue is that all this theory of correspondence of truth is a meaningless and useless model. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It determines the truth in terms of what cannot be measured. Therefore, it doesn’t matter how smart you think yourself is not philosophically impossible to get any ideal epistemological reliability of what is or is not absolute truth. That is why to try to find the correspondence of my words and ideas with some state of things in external reality makes the same sense as finding the correspondence of my apples with the moon. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
What kind of conformity are you talking about?And how do I find him out when I observe him? This is my main problem with traditional naive definitions of truth. Because they simply do not answer the question.They simply push the truth further into some dark area that cannot be known with any functional reliability. And this is not very useful.This means that it is pointless to say what is true and what is not true.Because there is nothing to refer to. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That is, why to argue about anything at all when the very thing that you need to prove your innocence is forever out of reach for everyone. What I want to offer today is a slightly redesigned set of definitions that take into account this fact. That is, only because the ideal perception of reality outside of reach for us does not mean that we should not even try to justify any statements about knowledge. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This only means that we should be extremely unambiguous in what specifically implies the word “truth”, and how specifically we will measure the truth when we observe it. To begin with, let's define the “reality” as just everything existing.Or there may be many real ones. And in particular, I find it useful to divide this idea into two subcateurories.I will call the first “internal reality”, Which means my direct internal awareness of sensory perception, such as memory or vision, or emotional states, all this. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For these things, I have a direct, direct, “incorrigible” sensory awareness. But, of course, I do not know what exactly causes them, and where they come from, and this is normal, I just want to state that I really have this direct perception of things. In contrast, I also want to define “external reality” as everything that is outside my direct sensory perception. And ideally, I would like to have a direct awareness of this place too, but it is simply inaccessible to me, nature did not give me this. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Thus, my goal is to come up with a certain agreement that will allow me to at least consistently talk about this area, no matter how miserable this attempt with my usual human abilities. Next, I will define a “judgment” as a verbal way of describing reality.That is, think about it as a statement, the statement of the fact. For example, “all bachelors are not married” or “water boils at 50 degrees Celsius,” these are judgments. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Then, we will define the “truth” as a marking prescribed by judgments in accordance with epistemology. That is, "it is true that all bachelors are not married" or "it is false that the water boils at 50 degrees Celsius." Perhaps this is not quite what many people think when they use the word “truth”, and this is normal. All I want to say is that in a strict philosophical context we need to delibe between the actual state of things in external reality and our mental abilities of understanding and describing this reality. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Moving further, now we will determine the "epistemology." And usually it is defined as a study of knowledge.But in this context, I want to narrow it to a set of rules that measure how well this judgment is agreed with reality. So, one can imagine epistemology as a measure that measures the truth of judgments. Or you might think about it as a black box that has an entrance, where you pure any linguistic judgment, Then it uses a certain algorithm in accordance with the rules, and the output is given the result in the form of the value of “truly” or “false”. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
I will sign this step in more detail later, but so far we will define it like that. Then I want to determine the "axiom." Usually it will be just the starting point of thinking. But for our case, I will use this word as a name for the rules that define my epistemology. We also determine the “belief”, which will simply mean a judgment accepted by the true, but at the same time it may not be true. And it’s just to state our error in clarifying a certain understanding and ideas of how reality works. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Then we define “knowledge” as a reasonable true belief. This means that you cannot say that you know something until you can demonstrate why this is true. Next, we have a “reliability”, which I am determined as a kind of conviction of the truth of judgment. In another context, it can simply mean the same as “probability”. And this is to contrast her idea of absolutiness.“Reliable” does not necessarily mean “absolutely”. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
“Absolutely” in a generally accepted philosophical context means something applicable to everyone, through all the time and space, through linguistic and cultural barriers. To be honest, this is only one of the possible sets of definitions that we could use. But as far as I can say, this is the only system that I reached, which does not allow certain confusing and contradictions. You can freely reject these definitions, accept them, or even help improve them into something more clear and accurate. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But all that I am trying to show is that we need to distinguish between certain key concepts, or everything else simply degrades into senseless nonsense. Holding it in my head, note that first of all, I spend the distinction between “truth” and “external reality”. That is, this is not the same thing.Reality is just a real existence outside my direct sensory perception. Ideally, we would like to know her, but we are also fundamentally separated from her. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
However, we still want to try and see how far we can go. Therefore, we begin to try to form beliefs of reality by formulating them in a set of linguistic judgments. Then we determine the epistemology that measures how successful these judgments are, and accordingly marks them true or false. The second important thing is that we have not yet determined a specific set of epistemological rules. And I am very sorry to say this, but anyone is free to determine the epistemology in any way he liked. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
I understand that it will be difficult for some people to accept it, but there is simply no such thing as an absolute universal epistemology. I can only give you a judgment, after which you will apply some kind of algorithm, and then tell me to label the judgment true or false. Again, remember that any objective perception of external reality is simply not an option. Therefore, we need to find out something else that, in the best case, can approach this goal. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And how you do this, you decide completely. If this seems a little unconvincing to you, then just imagine this problem in real life. For example, suppose that I have a dialogue with Ken Ham on the topic of evolution. Personally, I determine my epistemology in terms of mind, logic and evidence.And this is great for me. But does Ken Ham obey the same rules?When he very openly says that all of his epistemology is completely determined by the subordination of the literary interpretation of the Bible. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And you know what?This is normal for him.This is his epistemology. Let's recognize.Who are we at all to force him to something else? And moreover, we cannot simply open a bank with reality and objectively prove who is right and wrong. Therefore, if he wants to define his axioms like this, then to health. This may seem egregious relativism for many people, and in a sense it is so.But remember that all that we have done was separated by reality from our ability to know reality. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Objective reality still exists somewhere, of course, and we can make our best efforts to know it. We just need to admit that we cannot absolutely know anything about her. And that the rules that we have developed for this purpose are not carved in stone. Any allegations of knowledge should be based on some judgment, and the truth of judgment can only be determined by following some epistemological algorithm. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If some people do not like this, then do not worry, there is the only epistemological system that is objectively better than others. And even Ken Ham himself will not be able to deny this. And this system is the basic philosophical "pragmatism." Because, sooner or later, you will need to translate your beliefs into actions.And actions have objective consequences. But this discussion will wait until the next time.And now remember that the truth is just a marking that we find out through the adherence to epistemology. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Holding this principle in the head, let's think about what this means for some other philosophical points of view. For example, if you read at least one book from Christian apologists, then you noticed that they have some kind of wild fetish of the idea of “absolute truth”. And as far as I can judge, there are several different ways to interpret this, which we will now consider. For example, one interpretation is that truth is simply a synonym for reality itself. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That is, if someone asks you: "Is there absolute truth?"Then in reality he implies: "Is there existing?" If you look at this in this context, then we see that the answer is definitely “yes”, of course, of course the existing exists. But this is how to ask “is the reality of real?”, The question literally answers itself.So, what is next? You can immediately see that the problem is nothing more than empty tautology. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
She leads us to a dead end.But Christians and philosophers write entire chapters of books on this issue. Therefore, really, it’s hard for me to believe that this is what people mean when they say about the absolute truth.Because the discussion immediately comes to a dead end. And, of course, do not forget the deeper problem of how specifically we can find out the truth of something when we defined the truth itself as something outside our epistemological reach. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That is, you see that this is a very bad definition.In the sense of yes, of course, there may be absolute truth and is somewhere there, But do we really need to give up hope to ever objectively know her?Do we really need hundreds of pages with justifications for embellished tautology? Personally, I don't think so.I think this is a bad definition.Because it simply does not lead us anywhere. Now let's look at another concept of truth, which constantly pops up.I will call her “platonic” definition of truth. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
I did not see this specifically to be determined, but there is this implied assumption that people apparently accept for granted. And this is the idea that truth is literally a kind of integral physical parameter of judgments. For example, someone can say that electrons have an integral charge and mass, and these are just the parameters of this particle. And in the same sense, judgments have their own integral truth, and this is just a parameter of judgment itself. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Well, again, this is not the worst definition, because some are even used to talking about the truth in this way, and this is normal. But the problem is that it falls apart when we try to apply it at a really deep fundamental philosophical level. For example, if truth is a literal independent essence, then how do we know this?Is it true that truth is such an essence?And what is the measurement standard? We already see that we are again rolling into the same old problems.Because if the truth is again in the outside world, then again we cannot know it in a strict objective sense, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And we still have to determine some epistemology that will measure it. Therefore, this returns us to where we started. But let's go further, and we will accept it absolutely literally that all judgments have their own integral objective meaning of truth. Then what will happen if I give you the following judgment: "This proposal is false." This is called the “paradox of the liar”, and just think about it, because if the truth were some kind of literal parameter of this sentence, then we have a big problem. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This proposal seems to be caused by the collapse of the universe itself, because it is an absolute paradox. It cannot be true or false, because both options make a contradiction. And in my opinion, this clearly indicates that judgments cannot have their own objective platonic essence of truth, otherwise we are faced with all kinds of problems. Now, let's see what will happen if we recall that the truth is just a marking. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, let's return to the analogy of epistemology with buckets. I give you a judgment, for example, a sheet of paper with an inscription, And then you use some axioms to determine its value of truth. And in this case, maybe you will be “false”, so you just throw a judgment in the false bucket and walk on. That's all, the problem is solved.If this statement does not have any descriptive power, and it cannot be agreed with anything significant, then I will simply call it a false statement. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Note that there is nothing contradictory in this process at all, and he removes so much philosophical headache. Let's go further and look at the idea of absolute truth.You give me a judgment, I use some axioms, and I throw it into a false bucket. There are no contradictions, there are no empty tautologies, only a simple algorithmic process. But, again, the critic may object that this gives everyone permission to believe in everything they want. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And the critic is even partially right in this. But, real, and what?People around the world believe in all kinds of nonsense for idiotic reasons, And I do not see any mystical judge of reality that stops them. People simply have the right to believe what they want, and act in accordance with these beliefs. And if you do not like it, then this is normal, because the only objective judge is whether or not the consequences of your actions are desired for you. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But we will talk about this subject next time.Now let's generalize what we have learned today. External reality can really be an absolute universal thing, But the simple fact is that we cannot know this reality with any ideal reliability. Truth is not a real essence in the real external world, Truth is a marking, a purpose given by judgments in accordance with epistemology. All this obsession of some people with “absolute truth” is simply a philosophical impasse. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In the best case, she leads to meaningless tautology, and in the worst simply collapses due to internal contradictions. The main thing, let's just admit that we are cut off from reality, and this is so. We may try to understand external reality, but the ideal absolute reliability is simply not an option. This is just the nature of my own subjective internal reality. Let's seriously comprehend this fact and go further.
