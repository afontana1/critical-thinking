title: "The Language of Logic"

<br>

<div>
<p>
There is a classic episode of the original “Star Trek”, where Spock commands the crew in an extreme situation after an emergency landing on a distant planet. While the crew is desperately trying to repair the damaged ship, hostile aliens interfere with their aggressive attacks. Dissatisfied with this danger, one of the crew members requires permission to incinerate monsters with their blasters to eliminate this threat. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
However, Spock refuses and insists that the non -lethal demonstration of force will be sufficient to scare them away without bloodshed. He immediately orders the crew to fulfill his plan, but, unfortunately, this gives a terrible reverse result. Instead of running away in horror, aliens react more fierce attacks than before, and they even kill some crew members. This is a terrible tragedy that culminates in a hot dispute between the term and McCoum. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
“Well, Mr. Spock, they were not very scared, right?” - The most illogical reaction.We demonstrated our superior weapons, they had to run. “Do you mean that they had to begin to respect us?”- & nbsp; Of course! - Mr. Spock, respect is a rational process.It never occurred to you that they could react emotionally?Anger?! - Doctor, I am not responsible for their unpredictability. - They were perfectly predictable for anyone who has feelings.You could admit, Mr. Spock, your precious logic set them on us. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
- This is the most illogical.- & nbsp; my logic has already got me!- We could use a little inspiration! - Strange, step by step, I made correct and logical decisions, but despite this, two people died. The skeptical writer Julia Gailif once analyzed this episode in her presentation at the Skepticon in 2011, and I think she expressed very deep ideas about the Hollywood description of logic. Remember that Spock should serve as a lively embodiment of pure logical thinking, but his behavior is completely clear by anything like that. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In the end, how logical are your decisions can really be if they constantly cannot make the expected result? But instead of taking responsibility for obvious failures in his own thoughts, he actually blames the world for his inconsistency with his desires. In fairness, Hollywood fantasy writers are not quite experts in logic, and they most likely do not have an incentive to perform this function. But this still does not justify such a terrible image of logical thinking. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Very few people have a privilege of studying all this in any comprehensive format, And this means that the rest of us can only fill this void with any scattered fragments that we find in our mass culture. A logical result is a widespread misconception about what exactly is logic, how logic works and how really we are really competent in the use of logic in our daily life. To illustrate, if we consider the “philosophy of the Vulcan” literally, then a logical agent is apparently the one who simply suppresses his feelings. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Thus, in order to be “logical”, you just need to be cold -blooded, non -impulsive and non -intuitive. All decisions taken in this state of mind will be “good” and “correct” by definition, in spite of any consequences. But if this is really what the logic is, then who wants to accept it at all? The main message looks so that “too much” logic will simply turn us into insensitive robots, because of which people are killed! It is important to understand that logic is the most important building element of our modern lifestyle, and we only harm ourselves, distorting its mechanisms to society. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Logic is not just suppressing emotions, but a set of mental tools designed to help us to understand the world. Life is crowded with serious problems that affect each of us on a global scale, and we cannot expect to solve them through spontaneous intuition alone. It is difficult to work hard to analyze all problems and formulate solutions, but the main tools necessary for this process are thoughtlessly distorted and demonized by our media. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But what is "logic" in reality?It is not easy to answer this question, and even respected authoritative sources sometimes do not give a reliable, unequivocal answer. For example, some authors describe logic as “study of proper thinking” or “study of reasonable conclusions”, Others can describe logic as “thinking about thinking” or “science of reasoning and argumentation”. These are completely valid descriptions, but they usually lack certain philosophical clarity. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is like an attempt to determine what "sport" is.There are many vague definitions, but any of your specific answer will inevitably be very angry with certain groups of people. Nevertheless, only because the definition can never be absolutely and absolutely ideal, this does not mean that we need to stop trying at all. There is an avalanche of unnecessary confusion, and only a few simple mental experiments are required to ensure a real understanding. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
To begin with, imagine, I took a baseball ball and put it in your hands, what exactly do you experience? Naturally, you can see him, touch him, try and sniff him.He has a mass, volume, texture and a certain position in space and time. Obviously, this is the most tangible manifestation of the material object of all. But imagine that I asked you to hold the game in baseball in your hands.Now what will you experience? What exactly does this mean?Does the game occupy a certain position in space?Can you touch it?Weigh her?Measure its volume? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Of course not.But why?What is the difference? Obviously, the difference is that the game in baseball is not a tangible object.This is something that people do. When you observe the game in baseball, you are not watching the game as such, Instead, a much more reliable description is that you look at people when they play baseball. In other words, they are involved in the process defined by the rules. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
While they are collectively choosing to follow the rules of baseball, we can say that they play baseball. And when they choose not to follow the rules, they simply do not play baseball anymore, they do something else. Similarly, logic operates on very similar principles. This is not a single independent essence, and it does not occupy a particular place in the universe. And this is the process in which people are involved.This is something you are doing. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
When people choose to follow the rules of logic, we simply say that they are logical. And when people cannot follow the rules of logic, they are not logical. But unlike baseball, which defines the rules for sports activities, logic is a set of rules built into the human language. This is a way to express itself strictly so that ideas can clearly come and formally analyze. At this moment, it is important to focus on, because there is a huge community of “especially gifted” philosophers who constantly refuse to understand such distinctions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is especially common among religious apologists, when the lack of spatial position is immediately equalized with literal “transcendence” outside the limits of our material universe. One classic manifestation of this misunderstanding is the famous “transcendental argument” in favor of the existence of God, who is trying to derive the existence of God from the laws of logic themselves. In general terms, all this is based on a naive point of view called "logical realism" -when logic is treated as a separate independent power that exists objectively and regardless of any human influence. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Almost like the etheric energy field that surrounds us, permeates us and holds the fabric of space and time itself. Reality, of course, is such that the logic is fundamentally human invention. As English, Spanish and Japanese, linguistic agreements created by people are linguistic agreements.In the same way, logic is just another similar agreement. Many logical systems are even literally described as “formal languages”, In contrast to “informal” or “natural languages”. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
To see why this distinction can be important, imagine that someone has uttered the next sentence of the natural language: "I saw a man on a hill with a telescope." This is a completely normally designed English sentence, but you may notice that it demonstrates a specific property. Namely, the meaning of this proposal is not clear.I had a telescope?In a person?Or no one, but the telescope just stood on the hill? There is no “objectively correct” answer to this question, without any external context for reinforcement. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is a well -known quality of the natural language called "ambiguity" - The property of the assumption of many interpretations for this proposal. This is not necessarily a bad property, notice.And there are many situations when it can even be present intentionally. For example, a “pun” is a special style of jokes that purposefully uses ambiguity for a comic effect. Poets and authors of songs often deliberately enjoy ambiguity to add many layers of meaning to their texts. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Even sellers and charlatans can use ambiguity to make loud statements, while not necessarily promising something specific. For some, all this is fine, but what happens when ambiguity leads to expensive misunderstandings? For example, maybe I want to borrow money in a bank or, possibly, launch rockets into space. These are situations that require as little ambiguity as possible, as far as possible, and therefore force to use a much more stringent language. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Thus, the “formal language” can be considered as any structured complex of rules designed to reduce ambiguity. Scientists, engineers, programmers, lawyers and mathematicians are big lovers of formal languages, Because the structure of these professions is built on accurate communication. To demonstrate, let's use a formal language to clarify the meaning of our sentence of a natural language. "I saw a man, and the man was on the hill, and there was a telescope on the hill." Note that this proposal is much more clear than its predecessor, thanks to the use of the word "and". 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is an exemplary example of an instrument called “logical ligament”. And she literally binds judgments together, for the formation of more complex expressions. There are a whole bunch of such ligaments with which you are most likely familiar, such as “not”, “or”, “excluding or”, “if” and so on. And all of them are included in the field of classical “logic of statements”. It is also in no way a unique system, and there are all kinds of interesting offers that we can construct through alternative logical systems. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, suppose I will tell you that for each car there is a driver on the highway. This excellent proposal was created thanks to the “First Order Logic”, which tells us how to use such tools as “Quantor of Universality” and “Cover of existence”. Another interesting system that you could hear is called is called “modal logic”, and it basically makes sense to words like “possibly”, “necessary” and “actually”. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
These words are called “modal operators”, and they allow us to construct such excellent sentences as: "It is possible to paint the car in red, but it is necessary to put wheels on it." All this is still understandable, but in logic there is much more than a set of verbal tools for constructing complex sentences. Often we need to analyze the relationship between ideas, for which the definition of a certain formal way of expressing these relations helps well. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That is why no logical system can really be completed without any additional binding “deductive system”. In the simplest form, the deductive system is very similar to the idea of grammar, which we usually associate with natural languages. But only instead of managing the stream of words in a single sentence, the deductive system controls the stream of sentences in the argument. To see how it works in practice, let's take a scene from the classical comedy “Robin Hood: Men to Triko” and consider the following English sentences: 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Number one: "Royal illegally to the forest to commit this wild murder in." Number two: "It is illegal to commit murders of wild pigs in this royal forest." Note that both of these sentences contain exactly the same set of words, but in different locations. The first location is usually considered “bad”, in the simple sense that words do not follow the proper rules of grammar. As a result, your brain was most likely unable to identify some holistic meaning from them. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In contrast, the second location is usually considered “good”, because it follows the rules of grammar. That is why your brain was able to highlight the meaning from it, in accordance with the established agreements. Similarly, the “argument” behaves in a very similar way. Just start with a set of sentences called “prerequisites”, and then apply some “conclusion rules” to see whether or not of them follows a “conclusion”. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For demonstration, consider the basic structure of the classical “syllogism”: PROPRAME 1: All people are mortal. Prerequisite 2: Socrates is mortal. Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is a person. Now compare it as follows: PROPRAME 1: All people are mortal. Prerequisite 2: Socrates is a person. Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal. Again, we see the very same scenario as before, when both arguments contain identical words, but in different locations. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Just as the grammar dictates the correct receipt of words in the sentence, we clearly see that the logic dictates the correct receipt of sentences in the argument. Therefore, the first argument is declared universal, for a simple reason that it does not follow the rules of formal syllogism. In the same way, the second argument is declared valid, because it already follows the rules! Keep in your head that there is no universally correct way to combine words in the sentence of a natural language. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Languages around the world calmly mix and combine the receipt of nouns, verbs, adjectives, grammatical forms and so on, And no one asks what arrangements are “objectively real”. The only thing that is important is our consent of this agreement so that meaningful communication is possible. Anyone who refuses to follow the coordinated rules of grammar, such as English, will ultimately be unable to speak effectively with other native speakers. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In the same way, the same principle is applied to logic. There is no universally correct way to combine judgments together in the argument, But there are the rules that we agreed to, for the implementation of communication. The phrase “all people are mortal” itself, is simply an announcement of a simple rule: You show me an example of an object that is a “man”, and from now on I agree to identify this object “mortal”. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Why should anyone feel obligated to do this?Because it just means saying that all people are mortal. Therefore, if you eventually come to me with the judgment that Socrates is a person, then we can only follow the rule, declaring Socrates and Socrates in the same way. This has nothing to do with the objective position of the outside world, and this is an agreement in language and understanding. In principle, I can calmly violate this agreement, refusing to accept Socrates’s mortality, but as a result I will only receive an unnecessary misunderstanding and disappointment. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It will be, how to say: "Hey guys, let's play hockey!?"Then abruptly throw a ball for rugby at the goalkeeper and start yelling to the judge "Shah and Mat!" This is the game not according to the rules. This idea is important because it directly conflicts with the classical philosophical principle, known as "rationalism" - The idea that pure deductive logic is the highest source of all human knowledge. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
According to many popular schools, this doctrine really convinces you that the deepest secrets of life, the universe and everything else Everyone can be perfectly understood if you just sit in a chair and think about them very hard. Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz, everyone was known for the separation of this position, And we can easily see their influence on more modern philosophy. For example, the “ontological argument” in favor of the existence of God is a classic manifestation, In which the very idea of God can allegedly be used to deduction of His own existence. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is an exemplary example of the impudent philosophical "vicious circle", Because pure logic in itself will never tell you anything about objective reality. In the best case, she can only tell you whether or not your attempts to describe reality correctly formulated. For demonstration, imagine that I filled the entire argument with completely meaningless delirium like this: PROPRAME 1: All Flurbls are Snuffins. Prerequisite 2: Zarki is a Flurbl. Conclusion: Therefore, Zarki is a Snuffin. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Note that we again have a completely valid argument, in the simple sense that it simply follows the correct rules of logic. Not paying attention to the fact that Flurbble, Snuffin and Zarki do not have the meaning in English, The conclusion follows logically from the prerequisites in accordance with the syllogistic agreement. You show me an example of an object that is a Flurblle, and I agree to categorize a similar object as a Snuffin. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Obviously, something very important is still missed in our logical model. In the end, why should I or any other take the judgment that all the Flurbls are snuffs? What authority is imposed on anyone's obligation to do this statement? Maybe some dictionary contains a decree that categorizes them in accordance with? Maybe there is a children's program where the characters follow this rule?Maybe in an unexplored corner of Madagascar, scientists experimentally discovered this phenomenon? But what if some neighbor’s grandmother simply uttered this fact the other day, and she had never been mistaken before? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That is why you usually cannot engage in logic without any additional formal system of "semantics". Because, we can agree all day with the basic structure of a certain deductive system, But this will not bring much benefit, without any authority through which the prerequisites will be established at all. For this purpose, it usually helps to associate our judgments with a certain indicator, which officially establishes their authoritative correctness. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In logic, this is called the “meaning of truth”, and it is usually expressed through binary set, containing elements “truly” and “false”. Thus, to say that the judgment is true is essentially to say that you accept it as a prerequisite, and you agree to follow the formal agreements of some deductive system. The judgments that are false do not take place in this regard. This is still very intuitive, but it is important to always keep in mind that we are not obliged to accept binary many values of truth. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, some logic systems use three values of truth, instead of two, and therefore are called "trinutic logic". Another well -known system is called “unclear logic”, and it uses a whole spectrum of truth values, denoting them in the range of all real numbers between 0 and 1. In principle, you can go to the board right now and invent your own, completely original logic, which uses 17 values of truth every second Thursday. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Again, there is no “objectively correct” system, but only a set of rules that we managed to agree on for the purpose of communication. And since the binary system is simple, familiar and functional, It almost always eventually turns out to be an actual presumption in most situations. When we finally agreed with the official system of truth values, the next step will formally establish which judgments are true and which are false. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In logic, this is known as “the function of prescribing truth”, but many sources also call it “interpretation”. Then, to “interpret” the logical judgment means to appoint him the corresponding meaning of truth. For demonstration, we will again consider a simple judgment that "all people are mortal." Is it "true"?Or is it "false"? One interpretation may consist in the fact that each person we have ever met so far has been mortal, and therefore we can simply accept this for granted, that all future people will be mortal. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Alternatively, you can say that the English dictionary specifically defines mortality as an integral characteristic of people, thereby making it true by definition. Or in general, maybe you think that a neighbor’s grandmother is the highest authority in all mortal objects, and therefore, if she said so, then this should be true. These are all completely valid interpretations, in the simple sense that they tell us how to prescribe the values of truth for this judgment. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, if you decide to follow one of these interpretations, then excellent!We can finally build arguments on the premises that are officially true. However, if you deny these interpretations completely, then this is also great! All that this means is that you simply arbitrarily chosen the appointment of judgments in accordance with some other set of rules. Remember that in the formal context of the logic of statements, “truth” is just a label that we appoint judgments. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This means that judgments can be either true or false, but there is no such thing as the “primary essence of truth” in itself. Therefore, when you tell me a simple judgment, such as "all people are mortal," So sooner or later this judgment should be “interpreted” if we even expect to apply logic to it. At least one frequent interpretation method is just to directly affirm a small bunch of judgments and see what will happen. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Such judgments are called “axioms”, and they serve as very powerful construction elements for many formal languages. For example, according to the “Language of Natural Numers”, this is simply a real fact of life, which “for any natural number n, n = n”. Why exactly should it be like that?Because we said so, that's why! This is just one of the things that we decided true when we are talking about natural numbers. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is not different from the decree so that all the bachelors are not married men. All languages are built on the rules, and there is nothing wrong with the announcement of these rules in advance, as a fundamental parameter of the language itself. When the axioms of a particular language were officially established, the next step will begin to display new judgments in accordance with some kind of deductive system. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Any new true judgments generated in this way are called “theorems”, and they represent the main essence of almost the entire mathematical study. That is why we say that mathematics is an “invention”, not “discovery”. All that you have ever taught about the nature of numbers, sets, functions, etc.It all started, no more than a set of arbitrary axioms over which they operated on the logical rules of the conclusion. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If it sounds like a circular argument for you, then just remember that the axioms technically do not say anything about objective reality. Instead, they simply determine the fundamental rules for a particular language. If this language is well working in describing practical scenarios with functional accuracy, then it is fine. But it is important to always keep in mind that nothing physically obliges us to accept a certain axiomatic system. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In principle, we can easily mix and compare the rules all day, and there are many situations where it can even have advantages. For example, take a classic axiom of Peano that there is no such natural number N, in which n+1 = 0. Where exactly is it carved in stone, that we should absolutely observe this axiom from now on and forever and ever? Why not get rid of this rule completely, and replace it with something strange, like, I do not know, for example, 12+1 = 1. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Now we suddenly got a well -muffled system where all kinds of funny things can occur, such as 7+8 = 3 and 10+11 = 9. There is nothing mysterious and incomprehensible, it is just “modular arithmetic”, And people around the world use it every day as a practical system to determine time. All this was a small simplified look in the richest area of modern logic, But I hope you began to recognize the fundamental characteristics that distinguish logic. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Ultimately, “logic” is a little more than a formal language combined with a deductive system and semantic interpretations. Of course, this is not necessarily an ideal definition, and perhaps there are many experts who do not agree with thin details. This is normal, but we can clearly see that logic is something much more than a simple lack of emotional impulsivity. It is also not the ethereal force that runs the universe, but a linguistic agreement built on the rules. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The rules that are designed to help express ideas strictly and analyze the interactions between them. Therefore, the next time you break on a distant planet, surrounded by hostile alien monsters, Just remember that this is normal, feel a little emotionally. But it doesn’t matter what feelings can arise at any particular moment, you will eventually have to start making decisions, And probably you would like these solutions to improve the situation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Often we may not even have luxury of thorough reflection, but instead we must act on a spontaneous intuitive motive. However, in rare cases, when we have time for detailed pondering the problem, It usually helps to have some kind of official system for evaluating information, formulating an action plan, and then coordinating this plan among your comrades. Therefore, always remember that you can stop, take a breath and use logic.
