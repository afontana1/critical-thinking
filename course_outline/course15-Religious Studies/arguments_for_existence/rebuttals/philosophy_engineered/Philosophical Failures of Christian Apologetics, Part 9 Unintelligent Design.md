title: "Philosophical Failures of Christian Apologetics, Part 9 Unintelligent Design"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
There is a reason why science and religion are poorly coexisting with each other. There is simply nothing to do with this.These two structures are diametrically opposite in all philosophical relationships. While science is a research process designed to contribute to the pragmatic understanding of reality, Religions are cultural memes that strive only to be passed on from generation to generation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Science recognizes our fundamental psychological vulnerability and even takes active measures to exclude them as much as possible from our thinking. Religions, in turn, openly operate our “cognitive distortions” as an instrument for intentional stimulation of conformism among their members. Science implies human error, which means that any conclusions we will ever come to, regardless of how much we feel confidence in them, You should always remain open for doubt, verification, review and even possible abandonment of them. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But many religious organizations are happy to proclaim an unshakable confidence in their sacred dogma, Until the direct recognition that absolutely no volumes of evidence or logic will never change their opinion, no matter what. That is why religious apologists are always so strange antagonistic when it comes to science and scientific method - The rules themselves that control science and the scientific method are completely opposite to all their ideas about epistemology. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And over time, the conflict only exacerbates, because scientific discoveries always directly question key theological statements. For example, if the Bible is interpreted literally as a true and infallible word of God, It is inevitable from this that the earth was barely six thousand years old, and all its inhabitants were purposefully created in the forms that we see today. The first human man was made literally from the "dust of the earth", and the first human woman from the rib of the first man followed him. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This only human couple then blood -cellularly gave rise to the entire human race, Which quickly spread from its sources somewhere in the vicinity of the Euphrates River Valley. At the same time, on some moment of this path, a speaking snake appears and convinces the first woman to eat a forbidden fruit from a magic tree, And this action desecrates the whole natural world by a sudden outbreak of sin and death. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Finally, the only way to correct the state of things is, of course, through the ritual bloody sacrifice into the redemption of sins of the whole world And the deliverance of our appearance from the eternal spiritual disconnection with our timeless, non -material creator. Now compare this view with our modern understanding of geology and evolutionary biology. The age of the Earth is not 6000 years old, but more than four and a half billion. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Life is not a focused creation from some cosmic intangible agents, And most likely the emergent property of ordinary organic chemistry, working on self -reproducing nucleic acids. Human creatures are not a product of some organization “from above-down”, But rather, a long chain of hereditary allele variations, gradually formed by genetic mutations and natural selection. Humanity did not come from the genetic "gap" consisting of only two individuals, Instead, it separated from the earlier populations of hominids common in Africa. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
There was nothing close to any mystical “Paradise Garden”, and therefore there was neither “original sin”, nor the “World Flood”, nor the “fall” of man, And there was no point in sending any “savior” in order to “reduce” us from all this initially! This is an egregiously huge discrepancy that Christian apologists cannot ignore, And it perfectly explains the huge forced hatred against the theory of evolution. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If the modern scientific paradigm is true, then the Bible is mistaken.Simple and clear. And not just “not accurate”, notice, but egregatively, unforgivable and shamefully insane at all conceivable levels. Therefore, apologists have no other choice, except to withstand evolution at every step, Because it poses a direct threat of existence for their spiritual and cultural identity. However, they cannot simply put heretics in jail, as in the good old days, because, fortunately, most of us are now protected by secular, constitutional governments. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And they also cannot simply categorically reject the whole science, because it obviously works so great to improve our entire everyday life. Therefore, they have to resort to bypass cultural and political initiatives, such as “creationism”, “science of creation” and, of course, “reasonable plan”. “The theory of a reasonable plan claims that some features of the Universe ... that some features of living systems and the Universe itself ... 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And living creatures are best explained by a reasonable reason ... They are best explained by a reasonable reason ... They are best explained as a product of reason ... ... they are best explained by a reasonable reason ... and not an undeniable process, such as a natural selection ... and not a natural process ... And not an uncertain process, such as Darwin's idea of a natural selection acting on variability. ” Pay attention to how directly from the threshold the “design theory” actually announced its bias in advance, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Openly determining itself in terms of the initial rejection of evolution. This is a classic distinctive feature that emphasizes one of the deepest philosophical failures of the entire movement of creationism. Because when it comes to the theory of evolution through natural selection, creationists see not just the next scientific explanation of a certain natural phenomenon. They see the literal “war of worldviews” between the righteous forces of special creation and the devilish onslaught of materialistic evolution. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is an absurd “trabalistic” mentality that simply ignores the endless space of logically viable alternatives, Choosing instead of this sharply biased position “We are against them” in our search for truth. Accordingly, they do not make any test empirical predictions in favor of the design hypothesis, instead, spend all their time to fight against evolution -As if a simple property of some other theory to be wrong or incomplete, automatically ensures that their theory becomes correct. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is an exemplary example of our favorite logical mistake, known as “false dichotomy”, And again, the guys with real doctoral in philosophy are invariably unable to recognize it to this day. To demonstrate this, just consider the famous “Watchmaker argument” William Payili. This is a classic mental experiment, which is a fundamental chain of reasoning that underlies all the arguments of a reasonable plan. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In fact, all that he is trying to show is that intelligent agents tend to print some empirically discovered signs on the material objects that they create. Therefore, if we only learn to find these signs in living organisms, then we, apparently, will be able to use them to prove that life on Earth should be a product of reasonable intervention. Thus, as a demonstration case, we are most often asked to imagine a granite stone in our left hand, and then gilded pocket watches in the right. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If then we are asked to determine which object is a product of reasonable activity, in contrast to blind geological forces, then which object should we choose? Obviously, immediate intuition suggests that pocket watches were developed by reasonable agents, while a granite stone is not. Therefore, as the argument says, there should be some empirical evidence that led us to this conclusion. Moreover, since this was actually a banal distinction that we can make during a simple visual examination, It immediately becomes clear that we can trust the same perception in the same way in the study of complex biological structures. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, take a bacterial flagella, which is an almost universal favorite among the supporters of this argument. And upon closer inspection, he really seems like a kind of suspension motor at the nanoural. This is an impressive biological machine, consisting of a striking combination of complex interconnected parts. How could any material process, similar evolution, ever dream of creating a similar structure? In the end, this is not just everything was combined together due to a random coincidence; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And I also cannot personally imagine any specific chain of heredity, with the help of which natural selection could collect all this together. Therefore, evolution can absolutely cannot be responsible for the bacterial flagella, Leaving us only with a reasonable, supernatural, intangible agent who simply accidentally turned out to be Yahweh, the Almighty God of the Bible. It can sound like a dull parody of a complex philosophical position, But in fact, this is really the main course of thought, behind all the arguments of a reasonable plan. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If it looks designed, then it must be designed, and God forbid so that any natural process ever dreams of simulating this. Sometimes they even try to embellish it with a science -shaped jargon, for example, “specialized complexity” or “disproportionate complexity”. But no matter what they call it, the end result always the same classic mistake remains - the “argument from ignorance”. Scientists still cannot explain some biological phenomena to my personal satisfaction, in all conceivable details to the last, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, therefore, a magic wizard in the sky was to do all this. But let's assume that we feel generous and immediately recognize the statement that evolutionary biology is nothing more than a giant mystification generated by the devil himself. If you are not distracted by any other alternative theories, then what exactly can we learn from the argument of the watchmaker, by itself? Because, even with all the social bias and political motivation, there is really an interesting philosophical question that is worth exploring. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Namely: how do we “find” the design? In other words, how can we distinguish a product of a purely natural accident from a certain motivated agent of deliberately made by a certain? It is not easy to answer this question, but we can at least start a discussion by asking ourselves a basic, philosophical question: Is it really so impressive to “discover” the presence of the design in pocket watches? In the end, it is not so difficult to do when the manufacturer openly announces this fact in the form of a recognizable marking, scratched throughout the body. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Or, if this is not convincing enough, we can even visit the factories where they are produced, and personally shake hands with real designers. We also know, with a great degree of confidence that we will never meet a single natural source of pocket watches somewhere on planet Earth. We have neither geysers, no rivers, no caves, no fields where pocket watches simply break out from under the ground or fall from the sky completely formed. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, of course, we easily recognize the obvious design of pocket watches, because we already know in advance that they are designed! The main premise of the whole analogy with the watchmaker is nothing more than a rude philosophical scam. It’s the same as getting answers to the test before passing the test itself. If the idea of detecting design is really such a reasonable concept as its supporters say, Then, in principle, we must be able to demonstrate it in controlled laboratory conditions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, consider two material objects shown here. As you can see, they seem to be no more than a couple of stones that I randomly picked up from the slope of the mountain. However, one of these stones is special, since it was manually processed with a previously alleged intention for a specific purpose. What is this goal, or what was the processing, I'm not going to speak. All that you know is that one of these objects is completely natural in its origin, while the other was specially “designed” by an intelligent agent. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Your task is to determine where what, and do it with statistical reliability. Notice that now this is completely not such a simple distinction, right?And when you think about it, why should it be simple at all? Stones are simply an arbitrarily collected material substance, and a simple property that they were processed by some reasonable agent does not give them magically any empirically discovered “essence of design”. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, it does not matter what methodology you own, because the idea itself is logically inconsistent. The only significant difference that exists between the object of nature and the object of design is, ultimately, the designers themselves. Who were they?What tools did they use?What processes did they follow?What goals did they serve? How can I reproduce them?What tangible, empirical manifestations can we expect to observe and test, depending on competing theories? It is these questions that must be answered to logically justify any conclusion about design, and not refer to some cheap appeal to rhetorical intuition. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But, of course, creationists have no convincing answers to any of these questions, In addition to very strong perseverance, that biological systems simply very, very strongly look designed, And that no natural process can never be the cause of this. Sometimes they even openly admit that the theory of a reasonable plan cannot actually comment on either the personality or the methodology of their alleged designer; Only that somewhere, somehow, for some reason, he just did it anyway. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But after that, talking behind closed doors with their brothers-Christians, They simply accept, for granted, that, of course, the designer was absolutely definitely the god of Christianity, and thank God, science finally proved its existence. But hey, let's ignore all this again and completely recognize that people can really empirically measure the presence of “design” in material objects. Considering this, is it reasonable to assume that we have the ability to distinguish between “good” design and “bad” design in the same way? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
After all, biological structures should have been designed for something, right? So what prevents us from objectively to measure their ability to achieve specific goals? If they just suddenly fail, then what does this tell us about the competence of this alleged designer? For example, take a fish called the “blind cave tetra” of Central America. At first glance, it looks like a completely normal fish, with the exception of this strange convex mass growing from her head. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is strange, because it is terribly similar to some kind of pseudo eyeball, but in fact it does not provide any functional vision for fish. Therefore, ask yourself that good in a broken visual receptor for the body, which leads its entire life cycle in complete darkness? Is this a good design or bad design? Or, even better, consider the human worm -shaped appendix attached to your own colon. This is a small, dangling bag, which, apparently, does not play any significant role in the biological functions of a person, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
What proves the fact that people remove them constantly, never experiencing any tangible side effects. But every year, hundreds of thousands of these pieces are spontaneously inflamed, leading to a painful infection, and usually burst, pouring pus, if they are not treated. Therefore, you really should wonder: what idiot designer intentionally installed a ticking bomb of suffering and death in his supposedly “special” creations? Or my favorite: Ospop!Absolutely everything in this virus is intended exclusively for infecting and mutilating its human media on a global scale. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
More people were mutilated and killed by smallpox than all together wars and natural disasters in the history of mankind. If such a thing was really “designed” by an rational agent, then it can only be described as the greatest biological weapons of the mass destruction ever created. We can do it all day.There are many more examples of such, scattered throughout the scientific literature. Biomechanical structures rarely, if ever, are optimal in their functions and often do not serve more than any other goal, except for a constant increase in pain and suffering. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Thus, a reasonable plan is not only bad logic and bad science, but also ridiculous absurd theology. This argument in itself is an argument in favor of a weak, incompetent and unfair deity! Note that for the most part we ignored the science of evolutionary biology, And a reasonable plan even objectively errone at every thoughtful philosophical level. He does not make any tested predictions;He builds false dichotomy;He makes an argument from ignorance; He uses a "straw stuffed";He is trying to prove the negative;He makes incoherent assumptions; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And ultimately, he argues in favor of a deity, which can only be described as an evil idiot. The only reason anyone will ever consider this garbage convincing is that it is that by nature we involuntarily intuitively perceive the world in terms of deliberate actions carried out by consciously motivated agents. Therefore, it does not matter how terrible and failure can be a reasonable plan, Because the final conclusion will always be felt intuitively satisfactory for a naive and non -cooperative audience. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It is important to understand that whenever we make a comparison of such things as a pocket watch, with things like a bacterial flagella, There is a very important difference on which apologists constantly close their eyes. Namely, the bacterium is alive, but there is no pocket watch. This means a self -reproducing biological organism, subject to billions of years of inherited allele variations and natural selection during reproduction. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is a completely natural and uncontrollable process that physically guarantees the creation of complex, interconnected structures, up to the direct imitation of the foresight of human engineers. It is also a terribly careless, ineffective process, and it is completely united by the well -being of feeling creatures, And he has no choice but to be content with all the bad decisions transmitted to him from previous generations. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
He is completely self -consuming, he makes tested empirical predictions, he can be demonstrated on demand, And it has countless practical applications with real economic value. He explains everything that a reasonable plan cannot explain, and that is why evolution is the only theory of biodiversity that has “at least some” pragmatic advantages. But let's see the facts in the face.All this does not matter for fanatical believers, because truth simply is not their ultimate goal with these arguments; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Their goal is self -defense!They despise the idea of empirical predictive modeling within the framework of a rational, scientific concept, Because they know very well that Christianity can never survive with such a strict analysis. Supporters even openly recognize in their own internal documents and public lectures, that the very existence of a reasonable plan is nothing more than a embellished "wedge" - Purely political initiative, intended exclusively for undermining American scientific education, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Thus, paving the path for the rule of Christian dogma in mass culture. And this is not just some kind of wild theory of conspiracy, but a fact of open sources, already unambiguously proved in a real court! So let's stop fooling ourselves with a naive pretense that this is some kind of rational discussion against honest, intellectual opponents. Christian apologists hate science, because science is philosophically incompatible with faith. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, they are obliged to destroy or subordinate science by any necessary means, Because the inability to do this can only mean the complete destruction of all their cultural significance in the 21st century. A reasonable plan is nothing more than a tool for achieving this goal, driven by extremely miserable religious intolerance, and not some sincere desire for knowledge of objective reality.
