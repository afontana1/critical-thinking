title: "Philosophical Failures of Christian Apologetics, Part 8 Historical Jesus"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
We can say for sure that Christian apologists lead a deliberately losing battle, when the very existence of God is already an insane philosophical judgment in itself. To illustrate this, let's assume that we feel generous and immediately decide to agree with all the arguments to the last, nominated by Christians. What exactly will be installed then?Well, apparently, somewhere there is a powerful supernatural agent, He is able to conjure stable universes out of nothing, and he probably has personal interest in how people conduct their personal affairs. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is, in principle, that's all.This is a negligible form of “deism”, which absolutely does not help to distinguish Christianity among any other religious traditions. That is why, sooner or later, Christians should eventually begin to defend the Bible as a reliable historical report on truly supernatural events. And even then the only thing that fundamentally distinguishes Christianity from other Abrahamic traditions is the alleged spiritual personality of Jesus Christ. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Thus, despite all philosophical maneuvering and metaphysical postulations, Christianity either lives or dies on the historical reliability of Christ ministry and resurrection, as described in detail in reports from the New Testament. Now, before offering any criticism, it is important to establish what exactly is approved here. Remember that the very essence of all Christianity is the belief that about 2000 years ago The demigod half-chip born of a virgin was sent to the ground with a cosmic mission to atone for the sins of the entire universe

In the form of ritual bloody sacrifice, in order to satisfy the absolute justice of his omnipotent father/God/himself. He healed the patients, resurrected the dead, walked through the water, turned water into wine and spent his whole conscious life preaching the message of divine salvation throughout ancient Judea. Then, three days after the Roman authorities crucifixion, he rose from the dead and rushed to heaven in all his heavenly glory. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is really the last pill that you must swallow in order to rightfully call yourself a Christian. However, it is also important to understand that such stories are generally common in the history of mankind. For example, Apollonius Tian, Zoroaster Persian, Muhammad Arabian, Siddhartha Gautam Indian and even Joseph Smith from the north of New York are just a few prophetic figures like Jesus from Nazareth. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
All of them were documented as divinely inspired leaders who taught messages about spiritual salvation and even committed miracles in their communities. And on what basis do Christians claim to know that the supernatural stories contained in the Bible are legitimate historical events, and not just another bunch of cultural myths, legends and fairy tales? This is an important question that must be asked, because the answer itself is almost shameful to pronounce aloud. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In short, the totality of all the evidence that we have for any of the spiritual events described in the Bible is the Bible itself. Literally, the pure and arbitrary "I & nbsp; so & nbsp; said" human authors; The oral traditions that were soared millennia ago by representatives of extremely superstitious, illiterate cultures, teeming with professional deceivers and religious cults. We are very serious about copies from copies that were selectively edited and combined For several centuries, a series of politically motivated group decisions, and then translated into many languages. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is the highest standard of evidence that Christians expect to accept from us when we determine the historical reality of supernatural events. Thus, without even taking the first step, the justification for the historical Jesus is already so ridiculously empty that there is almost no point in considering it further. Nevertheless, the rationale for historical Jesus raises a very fundamental epistemological issue. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Namely, "How do we know the past?" In other words, on what justifications do we measure the “truth” of any concrete judgment about historical events? How do we know that Abraham Lincoln was a real living person, but Sherlock Holmes - no? This is another of those complex philosophical issues that again cause all kinds of academic disputes to this day. But even with all this, there are many well -verified rules with which every recognized professional historian will certainly agree. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, we can learn a lot about history and Christianity, applying these same rules to the biblical gospels. For example, one of the fundamental principles of the entire historical methodology states that any specific source of historical information can be false or distorted. This is just a life fact, given that the huge volumes of historical knowledge were almost completely obtained from written human narratives. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And we like it or not, people have a regrettable habit of incorrectly memorize, wrong to translate, exaggerate, To hallucize, lower or even openly lie whenever they record some information on paper. And it doesn’t matter what confidence you can feel, but simply does not exist such a thing as an “absolute” historical truth. In the best case, there are only various degrees of reliability based on empirical data and probabilistic conclusions for a better explanation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Now compare this fundamental principle with the doctrine of "biblical infallibility" - The belief that the words contained in the Bible were all “divinely inspired” by God himself and therefore are absolutely reliable in their form. This is the next classic attempt to completely circumvent “phalybiliism” and psychologically enclose oneself from the prospect of being wrong with respect to something - As if we should just accept all this on faith that none of the dozen biblical authors, scribes and editors 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
He was not even remotely capable of the slightest drop of personal bias, erroneous interpretation, embellishment or intentional forgery. And this is despite the fact that we literally have hundreds, if not thousands, well -documented examples just this in the early manuscripts of the New Testament. But most Christians, apparently, do not care.They simply decide in advance that everything in the Bible is an inspired word of God Himself, and therefore completely free from mistakes. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Further, in our list of historical methods, a simple rule stages that first -hand information is more reliable than the information from second -hand, which is more reliable than from third -handed hands and so on. This is just the application of the famous problem of the “broken phone”, where the information is inevitably distorted when it moves from one person to another. This is also the reason why almost all forms of “rumors” are absolutely unacceptable in any modern court - you simply cannot trust this. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, if someone considers the gospel narratives reliable, it would be very good if they were written by real people who really were there. But, of course, they were not there, and often they are openly proud of it. For example, absolutely nothing in the whole new Testament was written by Jesus himself, But instead, it was written by other people who simply claimed that they recorded the words of Jesus post -factum. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Even in the book from Luke, we find the implied recognition that he actually did not see anything of this himself, but rather that he simply collects stories from second hands from various anonymous eyewitnesses. Then the apostle Paul admits in his own messages that no one actually told him anything about Christ's narrative, and that instead he received all his news only through a pure revelation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Many events, such as Christmas, took place long before Christ met any of his disciples, and therefore they absolutely cannot be the reports of eyewitnesses under any conditions. Even the authors of the gospels themselves are completely anonymous, because all that we have is a religious tradition that tells us who these guys were at all. We even have no originals of the gospels, but only scattered fragments of copies from copies written a century after the events. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We even have several competing versions of the gospels with wild variations in all kinds of most important details, With nothing more than a religious tradition, which tells us that it is officially considered a “sacred scripture”, and that is simply an error -free human product. Therefore, we have no idea how the New Testament is a reliable transmission of actual events as opposed to the natural historical distortion. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Moving further;Our next rule in the historical method says that the more time passes before recording the event, the less reliable the report becomes. This should be quite obvious, given that the human memory is sadly known for that it lowers, replaces and even invents the most important actual details - The situation, which, as you know, is even more aggravated when social pressure is added to this. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Damn, do you think, why do people even bother to record anything? Memories inevitably change over time, so the sooner the narrative is recorded, the more reliable it becomes, And, accordingly, the later the narrative is recorded, the more natural distortions in it will inevitably be. Therefore, if the gospel scriptures generally receive at least some validity, the same thing that we should expect is that they are modern by the declared actual events. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Unfortunately, this is completely wrong in this case.For example, we consider the Gospel of Mark, which, according to the general opinion of scientists, is the earliest official record of the narrative about Christ. No one actually knows exactly when this document first appeared, but at least among scientists there is a consensus of the majority that it could not be recorded earlier than 30 years after the death of Christ. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This means several decades of rude, uncontrolled compilations from the mouth to the mouth before we get our very first official gospel! And this is an absolutely best option for us, because the other three gospels were definitely written several decades after that. Compare this with the obvious political and social bias inherent in any religiously motivated statement, not to mention the superstitious, illiterate culture from which it has grown, And it becomes psychologically inevitable that the legendary elements distort the narrative beyond recognition. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
By this moment, the question of the historical resurrection of Jesus has already been finally resolved without any rational doubt, Nevertheless, Christians are simply amazing when it comes to shove as much failures as possible into one argument as possible. For example, one of the most important rules in the entire historical method is the requirement that multiple independent reports should agree to the same message so that this information is considered reliable. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is another obvious rule based on simple probability. And all that it means is that several people are much more difficult for everyone to remember in the same way to remember the event in the same way than only one person. That is how we know that Abraham Lincoln was really shot at the Ford Theater April 14, 1865. We have genuine evidence of eyewitnesses from the crowd of people in the room when this happened. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We have evidence of the confederation conspirators themselves who admitted the conspiracy and carried out it. We have a report on the autopsy from a person who studied the corpse of Lincoln after what happened. And we even have the same gun from which Bout himself made a shot. This is a huge variety of independent sources, and all of them mutually confirm each other for every detail, almost without errors or mismatch between them. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Now compare this with gospel reports, which often borrow so much from each other that they cannot even be considered as truly independent narratives. Then, in other passages, they differ wildly in all kinds of fantastic details that cannot be confirmed by any external source. For example, after Jesus was crucified, the gospels describe a number of very outstanding events, Including powerful earthquakes and even three hours of darkness covering the Earth. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
You might think that if something like this really happened, then perhaps several local historians would record this, or that, perhaps, local astronomers would have noticed that the sun disappeared for three whole hours? But, oddly enough, such records do not exist, which completely leaves us with the miserable biblical “I & nbsp; so & nbsp; said” that all this really happened. But what is even more insane is how Matthew’s book also describes how dead people rose from their graves and flooded the streets! 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Of course, it is reasonable to expect that at least several local residents mention a sudden zombie apocalypse somewhere in their memoirs, right? However, even three other gospels cannot confirm or refute any of this, and at the same time it is supposed to be reliable narratives about the same events! And speaking of a zombie, there is one special rule in the historical method, which is often overlooked, although it is flagrantly standing out over everyone else. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Namely: any narratives that obviously completely violate the well -known laws of physics are the least reliable of all! Again, this is hardly a controversial requirement, because, by definition, such violations cannot be reliably demonstrated under any known conditions. And at the same time, human narratives in all cultures are sadly known for their ability to imagine the wildest fantasies with complete neglect of physical laws. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That is why we know that stories such as the Iliad or Odyssey are completely unreliable in their historicity. They speak in detail about all kinds of magical spells and superhuman exploits, while the gods of Olympus constantly intervene during the events - These are things that make no sense for objective historical evidence, but fit perfectly into mythological history. Absolutely the same is true for New Testament narratives.We are talking about a guy who was supposedly born a virgin, who walked through the water that expelled demons and who returned to life after three days lying dead in the tomb 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
- These are events that have no physical justification in all human experience! We know that women do not give birth to children without having sex.We know that people who stand on water are usually inclined to sink. We know that mental illness is not caused by evil demonic obsessions. And, most importantly, we know that dead people have a steady tendency to remain dead. Therefore, faced with the story of a guy, bleeding on the cross, only to resurrect again after three days, What should we consider more likely?That the laws of physics and biology themselves were specially suspended in this single case? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Or what, just “maybe” that someone tells the extravagant fruit of fantasies? Keep in mind that this is not just “my rules” to determine history, but simply “Rules” - The rules that are designed to make us be honest and help us achieve a functional understanding of objective reality. Violation of any of them is already a sufficient basis for doubts about the reliability of any historical report, But biblical narratives suffer a failure in absolutely each of them without exception! This, as if the Bible tried my best to win the title of "the least reliable story in the world." 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We are talking about anonymous human narratives written decades after the events, from secondary sources, With obvious political and social plans, and then translated through numerous language barriers. All of them make the wildest statements about fantastically impossible events, many of which cannot be confirmed even internally, and even more outwardly, through objective, independent sources. It is so blatantly absurd that even if the authors directly admitted that they had invented all this on a joint walk, then technically it would still not have done worse than it already. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
However, the very essence of Christianity is based on the idea that the transgalactic universal superior has a direct impact on the creation of these records and their preservation to the present day. Information, which supposedly ultimately determines the eternal fate of our immortal souls, And the absolutely the best that God can do is to convey it to us through hopelessly distorted evidence from the crazy cult of the Iron Age. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is what makes the Christian doctrine absolutely terrifying on a national scale. Because if you want to talk about the historical basis of the narrative about Christ, then at best the only thing we can confidently conclude -This is probably some popular philosopher Jesus, who served as a real basis for an exaggerated messianic legend. He was not the first example of such a phenomenon, and he is certainly not the last. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Nevertheless, the apologists would like you to believe that these narratives are more than sufficient evidence to justify the strong statement that the literal “Son of God” went to the ground, committed miracles and died for your sins. They have no respect for the most basic rules of honest epistemology, and instead they completely replace them with something that can only be described as a concentration of all efforts on strengthening the stupid conformism. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
As if all this religious structure is openly relied on the previously implied assumption that you are nothing more than a gullible idiot who will believe in anything simply because a smart guy in a cool suit said so. We are talking about the system of beliefs, where the very concept of “truth” is literally determined through the collection of Karakulya of an ancient, superstitious culture. The phrase “I am a Christian” itself can be perfectly synonymous with the statement “I am a gullible fool”.
