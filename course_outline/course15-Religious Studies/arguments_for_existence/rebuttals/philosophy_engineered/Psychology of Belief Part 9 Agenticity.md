Psychology of beliefs, part 9: Agency - The new survey just a few days after the destructive earthquake and tsunami in Japan showed that almost 40% of respondents believe that these disasters are signs from God. - A survey released by the Institute of Religion and Society showed that in relation to natural disasters, such as an earthquake in Japan, tsunami, almost 4 of 10 Americans believe that these are signs from God. 
</p>

Although this is true that earthquakes are destructive and terrifying events, but there is definitely nothing supernatural in them. For example, this is a well -documented fact that the entire state of Japan is directly above the large “subduction zone” formed by the interaction of as many as four tectonic plates. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Japanese were forced to suffer from dozens of severe earthquakes and volcanic eruptions throughout the recorded story. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And in the same way, it is not at all surprising that exactly the same amount of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions will continue to occur in the future. Because it is a completely natural and expected manifestation, given the listed geological conditions. This simply cannot fail. So why do so many people willingly attribute such events to the anger of a mystical deity when there is an obvious natural reason? Consider the following experiment. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Now I will show you the video.When watching a video, you must describe what is happening.Ready?Begin. So, it seems the triangle moved inside the rectangle. The circle and a small triangle appeared on the screen. The large triangle left the rectangle. A piece of a rectangle is slightly bent. Triangles collide with each other. The circle moved to the rectangle. And he is behind a bent piece in the corner of a rectangle. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
A large triangle and a small triangle collide even more. The circle went out and again entered the rectangle. The triangle is now under a rectangle.The big triangle is now randomly moving ... In short, a bunch of geometric objects appears on the screen, they move a little and then leave.What could be easier? Therefore, it should be completely not surprising that more than 95% of the subjects describe the video in a very same way, right? Well, in general, it should have been so. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If you look like most people, then this video is most likely perceived by you as something more than simple animated geometric figures. For example, you can assume that a large triangle and a small triangle are involved in some kind of conflict. A small triangle and a circle is clearly friends, or there may be even lovers. Perhaps you think that a large triangle is an offender or a jealous husband. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But despite this obvious perception, the video still remains anything other than lifeless geometric objects moving along the screen. This phenomenon is called "anthropomorphization." Most people will not only describe these objects in terms of animated creatures, but also begin to perceive them as real people, having a complete set of emotions, motivations, sexual characteristics, personal features and background. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In fact, this perception is so common that the inability to do this can be considered as a sign of brain damage. For example, subjects with autism, who watched the same animation, as a rule, will describe it in terms of geometric shapes, and not motivated characters. Similar results were obtained with victims of severe traumatic brain injuries. Therefore, the personification of the outside world is the ubiquitous feature of human nature, and its roots go deep into our socially oriented neurology. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Most of us cannot do anything with this behavior, and we need to realize this fundamental distortion in our perception. So how does all this relate to earthquakes? Remember from the 8th part that many people have a high level of "need for cognitive completeness." This means that when any event requires an explanation, then a natural tendency will grab onto any first answer that came across. However, as we have just learned from the experiments of Haider and Zimmel, an extremely common tendency among people is the spontaneous perception of the world in terms of conscious and emotionally motivated characters. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The final result is the process of the so -called "agency" - When we are faced with an incomprehensible and significant event, for example, with an earthquake in Japan, then there is a strong tendency to fill the emptiness of uncertainly with the conscious actions of anthropomorphic agents. Now, armed with this new understanding of the common distortions of human perception, let's explore one of the frequently used arguments in favor of the existence of God. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
- In 1802, theologian William Payili provided one of the best famous demonstrations evidence of a reasonable plan. Imagine how I found a clock on Earth.It is very interesting how the clock ended up here? Most likely I should not answer this, as I answered before, that the clock could always be here. Such arguments have many different forms, but all of them are part of one large class of arguments, the so -called “teleological” arguments, or simply arguments from design. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
These arguments are wildly popular among religious apologists, even though the most banal rechecking immediately exposes serious failures. For example, one variation says that the fundamental constants of the universe should have been “subtlyly tuned”, because the slightest deviation in these constants would not allow life. Apart from the fact that this is obvious nothing more than the classic argument of the god of gaps, the cosmologists have already completely refuted the premise. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
One famous study even demonstrated the possible variation of a suitable universe filled with heavy elements and carbon chemistry, in the complete absence of weak nuclear interaction. Which is even worse, it is difficult to imagine how our universe can be called "subtle" for life in some meaningful meaning. In the middle of the space shooting of meteorite clashes, cosmic radiation, volcanic activity, black holes and supernova explosions, The universe looks much more interested in the complete destruction of the life of everything together than in help of its prosperity. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The whole argument is literally based on the existence of some kind of space super-fire with the ability to accurately establish the laws of nature according to its specific choice, And a completely satisfied result that the absolutely overwhelming part of its universe is completely hostile to the very thing that was allegedly designed to support. In short, the real question that we should ask is not "who designed the universe?" Instead, a much more important question is, “Why are teleological arguments so insanely popular?” 
</p>
</div>
<br>

Consider the following experiment. This is a pencil.He was created by a man for a specific goal - writing. This is a pencil sharpener.It was also created by a person for a specific goal - to sharpen pencils. But this is pencil cleaning.They have no goal.They are not created for something.It's just a bunch of substance. Perhaps someone can use them for something, but they were not done for anything. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Is this difference understandable?Great. See it?This is a tiger.Ben says the tiger is created for something. Maybe it was created to eat, walk and to look at him in the zoo, or for something else. But Ben is sure that the tiger was created for something, and that's why he is here. Jane says it's stupid.The tiger has not been created for anything Even if he can eat, walk and live in a zoo, this is not what it is created for. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
There are just things that he can do, or people can do with him. Jane is convinced that the tiger can do many things, but this is not what he has been created for, and why he is here. Show who your right is right.Ben, who thinks that the tiger is created for something, or Jane, who thinks that it is stupid, because the tigers have not been created for anything. When you finish with a tiger, repeat this game with any pictures that you can think about. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
You can use hours, noses, rabbits, bicycles, anything.Just make sure that among your pictures there are natural objects without any meaningful function. For example, you can include a mountain in this list.In absolutely any sense that you can imagine, this object is nothing more than a bunch of dirt and stones that rose as a result of the actions of geological forces. She has absolutely no goal, and she appeared through absolutely aimless, random, natural causes. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Of course, no adult will be so naive as to attribute intentional design to completely natural objects, right? Wrong!When testing people of middle age, very often 30% of those responsible agree with the position of “created for something”, in relation to completely natural objects. This perception of design becomes even stronger when biological organisms are demonstrated, like tigers and rabbits. But in fairness, the tiger has no more real integral goal of existence than a mountain. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Because tigers are nothing more than the final result of a long sequence of inherited allele variations in a reproducible population undergoing natural selection. Although such a process is really capable of producing complex structures with a clear advantage in the struggle for survival, This has no more meaningful goal -setting than in geological forces when they raise a mountain of dirt. Now let's change the conditions a little. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The simple fact is that there are any other numbers, except zero, is already interesting in itself, but this is so far only half of the story. To make it even more interesting, gain yourself a group of five -year -old children and repeat the entire experiment with them. Of course, the unspoiled mind of young children will not be so inclined to teleological thinking, right? Wrong!In fact, young children show a very small understanding of the differences between the alleged goals of things created by a person, biological organisms and completely natural objects. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This makes teleological thinking an all -pervasive distortion of human perception, which is literally stitched in our neurology from birth. Only after years of disciplined training and the experience of the real world, such perception is inclined to decrease. So what does it all have in common with teleological arguments? This is how it works.As already shown, “agency” is a process in which people tend to perceive the existence of conscious agents as the main engines and designers of events in our environment. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The natural product of such a perception is a common tendency to see objects of the natural world as intentionally designed for some final goal, Even when most of these objects obviously do not serve any goal at all. This perception is especially ubiquitous among children, and it can disappear only when people grow up and smart. Therefore, teleological arguments in favor of God are literally infantile. 
</p>
</div>

They have absolutely no empirical justification and serve only as a call for our innate perception of causal agency that affects the world around us. - When I think about the incredibly rich complexity of things, the incredibly complex coherence of things, And the massiveness of all this, I find that it is impossible not to believe that God did all this. I can try, as a philosopher, to express it carefully in the form of arguments and prerequisites and so on, [or you can forget about all these stupid "evidence" and instead rely on the innate distortions of perception in the formation of your beliefs.] But this is not perceived by meSo, this is my existential reaction to the experience of the world. 
</p>
</div>

<p>
So, are earthquakes and tsunami really signs of divine retaliation for sinful mortals? Is the universe really “subtly configured” for a deliberate purpose of maintaining life? Or are these concepts simply cognitive manifestations of a tendency to perceive human characteristics in completely natural phenomena? - In the universe, a lot of things look like the result of the design, But, nevertheless, we constantly discover that natural processes, such as clashes of celestial bodies, Natural selection of genes, or even a convection pattern in boiling water, can create order from chaos.

And mislead us so that we will draw conclusions about purposefulness when it is not. But knowledge is preferable to ignorance.It is much better to take severe truth than encouraging faith. If we dream of some kind of cosmic purpose, then we can afford to choose a decent goal. [Translated vk.com/id79920293]
