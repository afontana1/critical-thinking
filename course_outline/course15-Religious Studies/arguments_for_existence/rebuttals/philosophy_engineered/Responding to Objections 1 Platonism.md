title: "Responding to Objections 1 Platonism"

<br>

<div>
<p>
Hi all.This is the answer to the most frequent criticism to the "philosophical failure", And in particular, we will carefully consider “Platonic Realism” or simply “Platonism”. I make a lot of statements in these videos, and many questions would be worth analyzing in more detail, Therefore, I am surprised that Platonism from everything else was the cause of a strong reaction. Not only in the comments, but even in personal messages from people telling me, as far as I am wrong on this issue in their opinion. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Most likely, there are not so many people seriously support Platonism, But those who support him, as if accepting it almost like a personal attack when someone is staggering their beloved philosophy. Therefore, my goal in this discussion is simply to show how absolutely lost Platonism is, because it is simply unforgivable to adhere to this view with our understanding of mathematics. To begin with, let's define Platonism itself. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Technically, when I say Platonism, it would be better for me to say “mathematical Platonism”, since the topic rose in the context of mathematics. But for simplicity, I will simply call it Platonism, because the main essence is generally the same. These definitions are taken from the Stanford online encyclopedia on philosophy, which calls three key allegations for mathematical Platonism. The first is what: there are mathematical objects that exist. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Second: mathematical objects are abstract.This means that they do not necessarily occupy a position in space and time or have a mass. And the third: mathematical objects are independent of reasonable agents and their language, thoughts and practices. If you think about it in another way, then even without people who talk about these things, mathematical objects and specifically numbers, would still literally exist. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But they “exist” not in the usual sense, like most of things, but instead of these abstract objects are in a certain special trans-all world outside of space and time. But even though the numbers do not occupy space and do not have mass, they still somehow manage to influence events in space and time. It is important to understand that Christian apologists absolutely adore all this, and is completely natural. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Because when Christians speak of God, they like to describe it as a creature that exists because of the need for His own nature outside space and time. This is a very vague description, if you think.Therefore, you can rightly ask: if God exists in this way, then what else exists in the same way? And interesting, Christians have a certain ready -made answer, and usually I hear that abstract objects such as numbers, of course, also necessarily exist outside of space and time. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, William Lane Craig loves to give specifically this argument when he protects the cosmological argument for Kalam. Therefore, Platonism serves as a kind of philosophical basis for the legitimization of the idea of God and the characteristics attributed to Him. And if you find yourself in a deep philosophical discussion with a Christian apologist, then this topic will be affected sooner or later, so you better understand the problem now until you are taken by surprise. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Of course, the problem of Platonism is very simple, there is simply no reason for it. And when you really think about it, he gives out simply shameful ignorance about the nature of mathematics. To show why this is so, we will go through a simple mental experiment that illustrates perfectly what mathematics is. We will start with the fact that we simply determine the mathematical set. And remember that in the mathematical language, “many” are just a set of objects, possibly real, and possibly imaginary, according to any invented definitions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, one possible set can simply be a lot of all white socks in my closet, and it will be a completely valid number. Another simple example is a lot of all possible combinations in the “paper scissors”.And again, this is a completely justified set. But now I am going to determine my own set, according to my own rules. However, first I have to give this multitude the name.Let's call this set of “many all tribbls”.And here you see here a lot, which I called the "tribblars." Remember that I am free to determine my many in terms of any arbitrary parameters that I want. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, I will determine the many of all tribbles with the following parameters. First: for many tribbls there must be an individual tribble element called Sally. Again, I could call her Rebecca, could call the queen of tribbles, but Sally would go. Therefore, when we are talking about a certain set of tribbls, Sally will play a role here by definition. Further, for each this tribblah element, another tribblane element, called the “mother of this tribbla”, is necessarily. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
"Why?"you ask?Just.This is what the Startrek canon says.All tribblars are born pregnant, so I want all my tribbles to have a mother who gave birth to them. This is my many, and these are the rules that I want to use. Now, you notice that the tribble mother, being a tribblah herself, should also satisfy the parameters of the tribbles. Therefore, for each mother of Tribble, there is another mother of this tribbla.And if we visualize these relations, then we immediately see that we have determined such an ongoing chain of tribbles. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We started with Sally, and Sally has a mother, and mother Sally also has a mother who also has a mother, and the mother of this mother, mother, mother, and so on endlessly. There is a key point that is important to realize, and this is that I just invent this crap from an empty place.I just invented these rules and names from the air. For example, I could say that for each tribbla there are a tribbble father and a mother-tribbble. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And if we visualized this, then we would see a branching binary tree -like pattern. Or I could say that each tribel has a mother and a child. And here we would see a chain that continues endlessly in both directions. Or I could also easily say that all the many tribblars consists of a tribbla Sally, the tribbla of Branda and the Tribble Diana. Again, this is a completely valid set, and I completely decide which rules determine many tribbls.Therefore, I will dwell on the rules shown here. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Here is the main question for all Platonists: are the tribblars “invention” or “discovery”? In other words, are there tribblars in its abstract trans-all world outside of space and time?Or are they just a product of my personal imagination? Seriously, stop and think about this moment, because if your answer is “yes” That, accordingly, any arbitrary set of words and relationships that I just came up with on the go should truly exist somewhere. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But of course this is flagrantly absurd.Of course they do not exist.I just invented all this. Therefore, the answer is obvious “no”, of course, tribblars do not exist, I invented them through a clean game with words. And this is normal.But when we understand that the tribbles defined here do not exist, I am very sorry, but you just admitted that numbers also do not exist either. Look.I will take the name "Tribble", cross out it, and replace it with "natural numbers". 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Then we will replace the name Sally with the “unit”, as marked by the symbol “1”. Now take a relationship with your mother and simply replace them with the word "increase", And, therefore, many natural numbers consists of a unit, units with an increase, units with an increase with an increase, units with an increase with an increase with an increase and so on endlessly. You notice when we go further along this chain of natural numbers, it becomes a little tiring to say “increase” again and again. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, I will begin to give the names to these things, according to the system that we will call the “account”. Starting with the “Unit” element, I will simply declare it with a natural number “one”. Then one with an increase will be called “two”, two with an increase in the “three”, three with an increase in the “four” and so on. Voila, now we have a standard set of natural numbers, determined in the elementary school in the mathematics lesson. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is exactly the same thing as many tribbls, previously considered, but I just crossed out the names and replaced them with new ones. Now remember, again, I invented all this out of nothing.I could use other names, or other rules, but I chose these names and these rules. And honestly, this is all that mathematics is.This is just a set of rules and definitions strictly used to obtain the relevant logical conclusions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And nothing more!And who says something else, he simply does not know what he is talking about. We repeat the fundamental thought.If the numbers really exist, then any set of rules and definitions that I invented must also exist. This is what we mean when we say that in mathematics there is no more truth than in classics, poker and chess. When you follow the rules of chess, you just play chess. And in the same way, when you follow the rules of algebra, you just do algebra. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
There may be times when you need to follow other rules, or maybe not. But if you seriously want to argue that the numbers exist, then you also argue that Shah and Mat and Fullhaus also exist. There is simply no philosophical difference between these systems.Therefore, it is simply naive, of course we just invented them and they do not exist without us. But let's analyze even more in detail.Suppose that numbers may really exist.And how do we find out?How do we demonstrate the existence of an abstract object? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, take the number “two”, if two exists, then where are the two that you are talking about? I asked Platonists before, and the best answer that they usually offer is something like: here are two apples.Put two apples in the basket, and here are your two. That is, there is a certain metaphysical essence of two, which magically leads these apples, simply because you put them together in the basket. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And you cannot really see her, but it is obvious there, because we are talking about her so intuitive, right? But no.Just look at the grammatical structure of what you say. Because when you say “here are two apples”, where is the “two”?These are not “two”, these are “two apples”. Or, for example, if I said “here are big apples” and wrote it nearby, note that this is a grammatically identical proposal. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But “big” is an adjective, not a noun.Therefore, the “two” in this context also cannot be a noun, because it is essentially an adjective. To say that “two exists” has no more linguistic meaning than saying that “large exists”. “Big” is not an independent thing, but a description of things. There is no “big” without things that can be attributed to the “big”. Therefore, to argue that “two” is a really existing thing is absolutely the same as saying that “big” exists.It's just inconsistent. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Two is not an independent thing, but a description of things. Therefore, again, the argument of the Platonists simply completely collapses, because when I say “here are two apples”, which I really mean, this is “here is an apple and here is another apple”. And if I say “there are three apples”, that I really say, this is “here is an apple and another apple and another apple”. But again, you see that it is simply tiring to say in this way, so we have developed a simple agreement that replaces these large long sentences with something more compact and effective. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is all that is the score, and all that it has always been.This is simply an invented agreement for reporting information. That is why we say that mathematics is “invented”, and not “open”. Because when I demonstrated the actual process of the invention, the question is closed, there is simply nothing more to argue about. In all this, there is no “discovery”, except for observation, that communication becomes easier when we apply certain rules in our descriptive language about the world. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, the Platonists are simply mistaken, and when they talk about numbers as existing ones, they literally have no idea what they are talking about. And I honestly find this with a disgrace when the so-called professional philosophers cannot recognize this, because it is not some kind of deep philosophical secret. As I said earlier, any decent school textbook on algebra will openly report that the whole process is based on axioms. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And what is an axiom, if not just an invented rule that determines the process of algebra. Here, please, the essence of all mathematics. I hope you liked this presentation, and I will be glad to answer questions in the comments.Thank you for watching. [Translated vk.com/id79920293]
