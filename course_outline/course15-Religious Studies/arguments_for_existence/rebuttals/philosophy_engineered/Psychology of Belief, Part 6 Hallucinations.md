Psychology of beliefs, part 6: hallucinations - And this cry came out of my soul, and suddenly, I never heard the voice of the Lord before, and he sounded like a Niagara waterfall. And he said a simple sentence, he said: "You will learn to be afraid of me!"And it was like this ... - God says a whole bunch of different ways.The first time he spoke with me in a voice, a lot of sound voice, many words, conversations. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
- And I became silent, and just began to listen to him, and this is what I heard, I heard: "I love you, Kerie, and I always loved you." Of all the ways through which a person comes to faith, the audible voice of God himself should definitely be the most convincing. All scientific evidence in the world does not mean anything compared to the personal experience of direct communication from God himself.

Indeed, it is very tempting to think about such experiments as direct evidence of human contact with the supernatural. How annoying it can be for believers if it turns out that these events are completely normal and reproducible. Consider the following experiment. Take a sledgehammer and hit yourself on the head very much. Then find several hundred other volunteers and also hit them on the heads. A specific performance mechanism is not so important, the main thing is that it is a strong, thorough head injury.

Then, after several weeks of recovery, ask them if they experienced any unusual side effects. If everything is done correctly, then somewhere about 1-2% of the subjects will talk about full-fledged visual, tactile and sound hallucinations. Moreover, the most common hallucination for today will be voices. And under the voices I mean the full perceptions of sound human speech, when in reality no one spoke nearby.

In fairness, it is likely that this person never suffered from a serious head injury. And it may be that this guy really heard the sound of God himself. But before jumping to this conclusion, let's first ask ourselves another question. If the head injuries are a well -known statistical factor for hearing the voices, then what else can vote? The answer may surprise you.The following is only a partial list of confirmed factors documented in the scientific literature: Bipolar disorder, migraines, post -traumatic stress disorder, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Social anxiety, a multiple person’s disorder, emotional deprivation, Severe loss, drug addiction, sexual Abuez, solitary imprisonment.And all this is just the tip of the iceberg. In general, it is impossible to say how many more documented and not documented factors can be for the experience of hearing votes. Moreover, many of the same factors can lead to visual hallucinations, tactile hallucinations and near -death experiences in completely sane people. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And there are more and more evidence indicating that the hearing of the votes is an almost everyday event through which almost everything passes at one or another. Hallucinations, especially the votes, no longer relate only to schizophrenics. So how does all this apply to the issues of faith?When people tell stories about the voices of God, angels, dead relatives and aliens, what conclusion can we come from this? Do such people really participate in divine communication?Or do they just confuse their own hallucinations with paranormal events? 
</p>

Now show special attention to this description of the listening of the voice of God. - But the truth is that God will speak with you in a “calm in quiet voice”, and this is just as an internal awareness, Well, you know, maybe you prayed for something, and you just fall silent in front of God, this is the silence ... And you just have this peacefulness inside, when something can appear, and you are not sure whether it is God or myself. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But this is just this knowledge that this is what God wants me to do, I realize this, this God speaks to me. This is a very common description of what it is, to hear the voice of God. Namely, believers often describe their divine communication as a series of sudden impressions and sudden confidence in something, and not as direct sound voices. Of course, this should be proof of the true nature of God, right? Consider the following empirical study. 
</p>
</div>

<p>
According to the testimonies of patients chronically hearing voices, the experience of hearing the voices is not always outwardly sound. In fact, voices tend to appear in a wide range of perception, with various degrees of subtlety and influence. In fact, one widespread experience is a phenomenon called "intervention." These voices are not like voices in the literal sense, but rather they are tested as sudden uncontrolled thoughts and motives that appear in the mind of a person.

These pseudochallucinations are especially common in people with obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression and attention deficit syndrome. Moreover, some researchers were even able to determine the specific neurological mechanism responsible for these conditions and cure them through a directed cortical stimulation. Therefore, think again, how is this information applicable to the issues of faith? When believers talk about a calm, quiet voice, as a method of communication with their children preferred for God, what conclusion can we draw? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Does God really instruct His followers through emotional impressions and an increase in confidence? Or is it just a demonstration of how even the most insignificant hallucinations, often experienced in a religious context, are used to strengthen the cognitive bias of the believer. Now suppose for a second that you are reading your scripture, and suddenly you hear an external sound voice, which says that it is a great Yahweh with its own person. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
How could you determine the authenticity of this, as opposed to ordinary sound hallucinations? Because, we just learned that such experiences can be, and often really are absolutely natural. Here are some tips.Number one - can other people simultaneously hear this voice at the same time? If so, then there is something in this.If not, then this should be a big disturbing bell. Number two - what kind of information does this voice reveal?This voice just tells you some kind of banal nonsense?Type "be kind to each other"?Or "you will learn to be afraid of me"? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Or does the voice reveal the really useful information that no person could know? For example, try asking for a simplified one -page evidence of the Great Farm Theorem. Or even better, mix the deck of cards and ask your voice to say the first 10 cards in order in order. Number three-can this voice do something tangible, which goes beyond the limits of a simple conversation with you in your head? For example, try to find out if this voice can grow an amputated limb.

Or at least just make any object fly from one end of the room to another. Or you can make your untrained cat perform dog tricks. Any of these things will be more than sufficient to win a million dollars of James Rendi, and something less will be just a recognition of a completely ordinary hallucination. So what did we understand?We have already established a huge variety of psychological instruments, with which people can generate real beliefs and ideas that were invented from absolutely nothing. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And plus all this, we also demonstrated that even a powerful psychological hallucination is a completely normal phenomenon that is able to very seriously burden all this problem. Therefore, the next time your friends tell you about how they heard the voice of God, bathed in the love of the Savior or felt the presence of angels, ask yourself: What is more likely?What do these guys experience real interactions with supernatural creatures? Or they are just ordinary people who became victims of their own subjective distortions, naive illusions and hallucinatory demons.

- What can you say to this?Because, I assure you, in my life all this was not a delusion. - If you were born in India, I dare to assume that you would say the same about Krishna and Shiva. If you were born in Afghanistan, I believe that you would say the same about Allah. If you were born in Norway during the Vikings, then you would say the same about Votan. If you were born in ancient Greece, you would say the same about Zeus and Apollo.
