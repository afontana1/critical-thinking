title: "Responding to Objections 3 Pragmatism"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
Hello everyone, this is a continuation of our discussion from the previous video about basic terminology in epistemology. In fact, there will be not so much answers to specific objections as the development of extremely important ideas. I think most people tend to follow the basic development of pragmatic epistemology from the second part of this cycle, and this is good. But this is what, in my opinion, deserves special attention, because, again, if you are not in the material at this level of discussion, then the rest does not matter at all. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We simply cannot have a discussion if people are not ready to agree to what specifically means “truth” (truth), and how do we recognize it when we observe it. What I want to do today is to start talking about what exactly the “good” epistemology should provide when we finally begin to build our axioms. And if you remember, the last time we set out the basic terminology, which, in my opinion, helps to clarify a lot of errors about the nature of truth. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Specifically, we talked about how we need to distinguish between reality, our sensory perceptions of reality, and our mental models to describe reality. And all that I did was offered a set of definitions that this is. And along the way, we saw that the truth works very well when we begin to think about it as a marking given to judgments, instead of some kind of independent essence. But, unfortunately, we also found that anyone is free to determine the epistemology in any way he liked, and nothing really forces to choose one and not the other. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In the best case, what we can do is to offer a set of axiom, and see who is ready to agree with them and who is not. As I mentioned earlier, it may be similar to egregious epistemological relativism, but it is really not so. Remember that it is just “skepticism”, this is the difference, You can have an absolute, universal, objective reality, it is excellent, save it, because no one seriously refutes it. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Everything that skepticism says is that it doesn’t matter how much you try, you will never be able to perfectly know this reality with any absolute universal accuracy. This is a distinction.It doesn’t matter how smart you think yourself will always be a kind of philosophical doubt about your ability to perfectly describe the outside world. Again, this does not mean that all descriptions are hopeless, just as it does not mean that all descriptions are equivalent. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This simply means that you are an error agent with indirect, incomplete, distorted perception of a large complex world. And I ask all the critics, and especially all the Christian-pre-situation: specifically what are you going to refute in this? If you personally are not an all -knowing about external reality, then this is what you have to live with, like everyone else. Therefore, please, let's take it and go further?I cannot even conduct a dialogue with you if you do not understand these distinctions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Given what has been said, our next goal is to finally try to build an epistemology. However, as you can recall, I did not specify what specific axioms we should use in determining the “good” epistemology. And it was deliberate, because I wanted to shine all this video to this particular issue. And specifically: what does a good epistemology look like, and what goals are we trying to achieve with it? This may sound like a very deep question, but I think the answer is very obvious if you stop and think about it correctly. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, I just want to ask now everyone is a simple fundamental question: Why do you "believe" in anything at all?Seriously, what is this goal?[Believe = are convinced of something] Why do we need this obsession at all, what is true and what is false? Remember that on a purely physical level we are talking about the connections of neurons in your brain, connected together to generate neural pathways. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
What can one set of neural routes “better” or “more true” than another set? In my opinion, this is a really important question, because at the time of the answer to it, we essentially simply determine the main goal of epistemology. And I am very sure that most of you even have simple intuitive answers to this question. But to help clarify the situation in more accurate terms, I want to offer a very simple mental experiment. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And I call him the "Superman problem."Imagine I come to you with the following statement: I have superpowers. And I mean that I really have superpowers.I am convinced that I am a superhero, just like a superman. I declare that this is true, that I can fly;It is true that I have X -ray vision;It is true that I am superpower and so on. Now, being a good skeptic, you will naturally disagree with my statements. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And maybe we will begin a big dispute about whether I really have superpowers. However, that if I just reject your arguments completely, and just insist with absolute confidence that I have superpowers? I concluded, in strict accordance with my epistemology that my allegations are true. And you, in accordance with your epistemology, concluded that my statements are false. And what will happen now?Again, remember that none of us can simply open a jar with absolute objective reality and settle these debates with perfect epistemological reliability. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is simply not an option.You have your epistemology, and I have mine.And we both marked my statement accordingly. Now, if this is the end of this story, then we will at a dead end.There is simply nothing left to say, and we will be forced to stay with their opinion. However, it is important to realize that there is one last element that we have not yet taken into account. In the real world, no one simply declares some judgment true and stops on this. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Sooner or later, people tend to act in accordance with their beliefs. Therefore, for example, if I am convinced that this is true, that I have the power to fly, then why should I go even then? The first that I would do was to climb the nearest roof and jumped. But think about it.I can not have a direct direct awareness of the absolutely true position of the universe, But I have the ability to make solutions and observe the results. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That's why I will do it.I will rise to the roof, and I will jump with a cry "flew." And it is very natural to say that if there is some kind of reality behind the statement that I can fly, then I reasonably expect to experience a flight. But if there is no reality behind my statement, then I must fall towards a terrifying painful death. In my opinion, this convincingly indicates an extremely important factor in epistemology, which is constantly overlooked. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Because, as I pointed out earlier, the reason why someone “believes” in anything at all is that we could eventually use this belief as a guide to our actions. This is the whole point to believe in anything at all.(To be convinced of what, if in general.) And in fact, this is so important for our epistemology that I would even say that the truth itself does not make sense until it is somehow connected with our actions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And to reinforce this statement, let's look at another classic philosophical mental experiment: What will win in the battle?A starship "Enterprise" or an imperial star destroyer? Stop and think about this issue honestly, because again, we can argue with each other until they turn blue and not reaches consent. And I know for sure that many of the fans did it. And maybe you even did everything that is in your power to follow the strictest standards of rational logical deduction. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But, honestly, really, what is the difference from this? It is important to remember that the only way to objectively solve this issue is to take a real enterprise and a real imperial cruiser, Bring them into the space arena and look at their battle. And you cannot do this when both objects are completely a product of fictitious fantasies. There is an old saying that, in my opinion, perfectly reflects this problem, and perhaps many of you heard it, And in fact, she asks: how many angels can dance on a pin head? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And this is a serious question, because for centuries earlier there were really Christian monks who spent the clock in disputes about such riddles. And this question symbolizes for me the problem of attempts to argue about the truth of something that cannot be physically confirmed. It doesn’t matter what answer you give, literally nothing will change. Not a single decision that you ever pretend in your entire life will never fall under the influence of an answer to this question. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Think about it for a minute.If nothing changes, even hypothetically, if some judgment is true or false, What is the philosophical difference here at all?The difference between truly and false generally disappears. Therefore, again, truth has no functional value without any final connection with the decision-making process. The whole point of conviction itself is something is to inform decisions and manage actions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Actions then affect events in the outside world, and these events lead to objective consequences. Convince any of these elements, and truth immediately loses all significance. And although we can’t open a can with reality and see what is inside, But it seems to me that this small chain of events really serves as a good approach to this ideal. If the reality is absolute and universal, as we all think, then we must expect that similar decisions made in similar circumstances will lead to similar results. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And personally, I think that it looks as close as possible from all our ways to approach real absolute truth. From what I can say, this epistemological look has several different names. For example, some people can call it “evidence”, and other “relaxabilism”. But one name that seems to me the most suitable for this understanding is “pragmatism”. And he says that the highest measure of truth or falsity of judgments is simply in their ability to produce results. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If some conviction is true, then what can I do with him? What solutions can I make in the real world with real predictable consequences? And how will they differ if this belief is false? And this leads us to the so -called "pragmatic maxim." And this is not quite an axiom, but rather as a certain definition of a task. Whatever axioms you use to determine your epistemology, but this is the highest goal that they should serve. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And as I understand it, the original pragmatic maxim was formulated by the philosopher Charles Pierce in 1878. But personally, she does not suit me very much, so I reformulated her into my personal version that you see here.[The highest measure for the truth of the statement is its ability to inform decisions when waiting for the desired results.] And if you have something better, then of course I would also like to hear it. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Keep in your head that this is actually not something new.And you can see that many philosophers borrow greatly from here. One of the more good variations that I found was written by the philosopher Alexander Burd. And he describes the position of a relaxabilist, but I think that it also works great as a pragmatic statement. In fact, it goes this way: there is some kind of agent, let's call him Karl. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
He has a desire D. Karl has the belief B that, having made an action a, he will reach D. If the belief of Karl is true, then the action a will lead to achievement D. For me, this is a great expression of epistemology.That is, as I find out the true conviction when I observe it. However, I think it is not finished.Therefore, I want to insert an amendment at the end, which reads: if A does not reach D, then belief B is false. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Then it is obvious that something is wrong with your beliefs when they simply endure failure. So, for example, we can say something similar: Karl wants to get intoxication. Karl has the belief that alcohol consumption will make him drunk. And if the belief of Karl is true, then the consumption of alcohol will give him intoxication. And if the consumption of alcohol cannot intoxicate it, then the belief of Karl is false. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Notice how we finally have a way to measure truth, which is completely in our “incorrigible” awareness of our internal reality. Literally, I should not make a single assumption.I just observe that I have specific sensory perceptions and the ability to make decisions. I observe the consequences when they follow from my solutions, and I observe that some of them are more desirable than others. Therefore, I choose to measure my beliefs in accordance with this process. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Of course, it may not be perfect, but at least some solutions reliably direct my future to better results than others. Well, please.All pragmatic epistemology is brief. And what is especially excellent in pragmatism, it turns out that this is not only my epistemology, but also yours. Because, we will be honest in front of ourselves.If I am not mistaken, then all of you are in a very same philosophical position as me. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
You need to pay bills, you need to feed yourself, you need access to the Internet, and for you certain situations are more desirable than others. Therefore, if you look like me in this, then my epistemology is also your epistemology. Perhaps you never consciously thought about it, but you definitely use it in a particular position. Because if you are not doing this, then very soon a bus or something else will just crush you. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
You simply cannot function in this world without a thorough understanding of the consequences of your actions. Therefore, until someone finds a way to reliably produce the desired results without taking into account our joint beliefs, It seems to me that we are all stuck in this same basic epistemological model together. So, in order to finish this discussion, I really want to ask everyone: which of you agree with this? Because there are only two options that I see here.You either agree with me that truth should be measured by your ability to inform decisions and make the results, or you do not agree. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And if you agree with me, at least partially, then excellent, we can finally have a real discussion. And if we disagree about some judgment about the laws and objects in external reality, That all we need is to do some tested predictions in accordance with our beliefs, and see what will happen. It is as if it is realistic and there is a mystical philosophical bank with reality, which we can simply open and observe together to settled the debate. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Of course, this is not absolutely perfect, but what else is there?What do you have, what works better? However, if this is not how your epistemology works, then I am sorry, but we cannot have a discussion. I literally do not worry about what you think.You have just recognized me that no your beliefs matters. I have problems that I try to solve, and you just mutter insignificant delirium in the air. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, please just leave and stop spending someone else's time. It is important to realize that this is normal if you find this look imperfect or incomplete. If you want to add corrections or make some new understanding, then this is great, I would like to hear it. But people whom I am especially interested in listening to listen are Christians.Because what really makes pragmatism beautiful is that he, like philosophical cryptonite for all Christian apologists. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If you are a Christian, and you measure your beliefs in a similar way that I, Then why are you bothering all these ridiculous philosophical arguments in favor of the existence of God? You can settle this issue right now by simply demonstrating God empirically. And if you can do this, if it is so obvious, then why haven't you done this yet? If the real God and Christianity is true, then what tangible manifestations can I produce for this belief through my actions? And if there are no such manifestations at all, then excellent, you have just admitted that there is no truth in the idea of the existence of God. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
On the other hand, if you are a Christian, and you completely reject pragmatism, then guess what?I am no longer interested in it anymore. Like everyone else, including yourself. Because you just admitted that God philosophically does not mean anything for a single decision that anyone can ever make. Therefore, who cares?Your belief simply does not matter. That is why I always say that the conclusion of God is not equivalent to the demonstration of God. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
You need something more than simple words, guys. So what will it be, Christians?This is the real philosophical dichotomy: Either you agree with the pragmatic epistemology, or you do not matter. You can argue as much as you want, but no your conclusions are important until I can use them to make any significant solutions with tangible results. Therefore, either answer your words and show us God, or just admit that you do not matter and stop spending our time.

The choice is yours. This is the end of our discussion today, and I hope you learned something about yourself. But before completing, I just want to thank everyone for participating in these videos.I like to read all your comments and hear your thoughts. A simple participation in the dialogue for imagining is very exciting, and helps to improve these presentations in much more clear formulations than it would be without you. 
</p>

<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, thanks to everyone, looking forward to hearing more from you. [Translated vk.com/id79920293]
