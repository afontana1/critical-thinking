Psychology of beliefs, part 7: projection - The main question is why believers from the camp of evolution are so trying to impose their faith on another camp? - But in truth, all that I had was a blind faith in atheism! - So you do not believe in God, and therefore you have such a religion of the lack of God. - And evolution is a stupid and dangerous religion in the history of planet Earth. How many times have you noticed a huge paradox for Christians-regionalists when they say that atheism and evolution are religious beliefs based on a blind faith? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
After all, faith, in the end, is one of the basic principles of Christianity itself. Therefore, it is paradoxical when the words “faith” and “religion” are pronounced with such arrogant mockery, As if theists actually have serious objections when people found their lives on these concepts. The paradox is further aggravated by the fact that the evolutionary theory requires the complete rejection of faith in the purpose of a full demonstration of its reliability. 
</p>

<p>
Atheism cannot be a religion, because atheism by definition is the rejection of religious beliefs. So what makes people find their own shortcomings in their opponents, and even to such an extent that they begin to deny the same shortcomings in themselves? Consider the following experiment. Type volunteers and give them a personal test. This does not have to be a good personal test, just convincing enough to think that this is a good personal test. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Tell them that a specific personality trait that is measured in it is a tendency to anger and hostility. Then, when the test is finished, give your subjects a fake printout of their results, and tell them that they are completely normal in their tendency to anger and hostility. Next, organize another experiment with your subjects, completely unrelated with the previous one. This time, let them read a short essay about an emotionally vague person named Donald. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
When they finish, ask them to evaluate Donald on 14 personal qualities on a 11-point scale. The personal qualities themselves do not matter, the main thing is that among them there should be three related to anger and hostility. Finally, add the final points of anger and hostility attributed to Donald, and find out the average indicators of the subjects. Given that the essay was emotionally vague, it is not surprising that Donald received the average value of hostility about 20. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Now let's change the conditions a little. Instead of frauding the results of your personal dough towards completely normal indicators of anger and hostility, punch them towards very high indicators. Now that your subjects feel more consciously about their temperament, ask them to evaluate Donald’s personal qualities, and pay special attention to his indicators of anger and hostility. Of course, strong negative feedback will have no effect on their assessment of the personal qualities of other people, right? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Wrong!As it turns out, the subjects, who received high points in anger and hostility, will include evaluating Donald a little higher in his indicators of anger and hostility. Although the effect may not look very strong, it is definitely statistically significant and stably reproduced. This phenomenon is called "psychological projection" - When negative personal criticism causes a stronger perception of the same criticized line in other people. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Which is even more interesting, the projection also has an additional bonus, which consists in increasing the denial of this very criticism that the subject receives. To see how, consider the following experiment. As before, give your subjects a fake personal test, only this time let's evaluate them for dishonesty, instead of hostility. After providing them with “scientific evidence” of their suppressed tendency to dishonesty, Let them evaluate the personal qualities of the next emotionally vague person. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Again, among personal qualities, be sure to turn on the three qualities associated with honesty. Then, relax and wonder once again how your subjects project their imaginary dishonesty on a vague personality. Now, we will change the conditions even more.After projecting their dishonesty, ask the subjects to fill out a questionnaire in which they will evaluate themselves according to 12 random characteristics, Just make sure that in one question the subjects must evaluate their tendency to dishonesty. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For subjects, who received low values of non -enforcement feedback about their dishonesty, the normal value will be approximately 4.5. This is also true for subjects who received strong negative feedback, but who did not allow to project negative qualities. The obvious question arises: will there be a projection of negative qualities on strangers to have any effect on how people evaluate their own dishonest inclinations? Of course, some negative assessments about some emotionally vague stranger will not affect their self-perception, right? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Wrong!Interestingly, the subjects, who were given the opportunity to project their shortcomings on someone else, really reported lower indicators in the self-esteem of their dishonesty. Thus, at least in this context, Sigmund Freud was right! The psychological projection really performs a protective function, enhancing the denial of human disadvantages. The reasonable criticism thus bounces from the mind of the believer and adheres to people who express criticism. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In other words, a defensive projection is “who is called, he is so called” from the world of cognitive distortion. So why do believers so love to expose evolution and atheism as religions based on faith? Is the entire field of evolutionary biology is simply a religious cult, obsessed with the proselytism of its dogma? Maybe atheism is really just a religion that is trying to recruit a convert? Or are these people just ordinary God -fearing guys trying to deny their own shortcomings, projecting them on others? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, atheism itself is a religion to the same extent as health is a disease.In the same way, you can reason on which brand of cars go pedestrians. Evolution is a religion to an even lesser extent.This is a section of biology explaining biodiversity. By virtue of this, it does not allow supernatural explanations, has neither doctrines, nor dogmas, nor fairy tales with moralizing; It has no rituals, traditions, holidays;She has neither leaders nor defenders of faith, because she does not allow faith.

<p>
She does not consider something saint, she has no places to worship, there are no spells, there are no clergy, there is no fashion for outfits; She does not advance and does not forbid to think that there are gods and souls;She does not say anything about how we should live, and what happens after our death. Therefore, evolution is not a religion.And creationists know this, but still they say the opposite.
