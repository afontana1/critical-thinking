<p>
Psychology of beliefs, Part 4: Disinformation effect -And from that moment I knew that now everything would be different, everything will change, for the first time I felt God. The first time I felt his presence, and I felt his hand. - This is the truth from the depths of my soul. After our general group prayer, and while I saw my uncle revived, The nurses ran out, ran out, and, suddenly, he began to speak, he just came to life, he came to life, and no one can explain it! - And this most beautiful light that spilled on me, and I remember this feeling and the immediate awareness of where it is, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And this was the first time in my life when I felt the Holy Spirit. Personal evidence.They can often be a very powerful instrument of belief, so it is not surprising why religious people are so happy to share them in an attempt to attract the converts. But despite their emotional power, can we really trust personal evidence as objective descriptions of real events? Consider the following experiment. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Suppose you were shown the following video of a car disaster. If I asked you how the cars drove quickly when they collided with each other, what will be your guess?25 miles per hour?Maybe 35? As it turns out, people are actually not very good in a visual assessment of the speed of clashes in such automobile accidents. Therefore, at a known speed of 25 miles per hour, most control groups were more inclined to assess about 34 miles per hour. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Now let's change the conditions a little. Although this is interesting that people tend to overestimate the speed of clashes, we are here for a different reason. Suppose that I will replace the word “collided”, with the word “crashed”. In all respects, this is the same question as before, but now I have applied a verb that has a slightly more powerful shade. Of course, such a simple reformulation of the question will not affect the further answers of the subjects, right? WRONG.As it turns out, the simple replacement of the word “collided” for the word “crashed” can distort the answers of the subjects to more than 40 miles per hour. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And even more interesting, you can get a whole continuum of meanings from a whole bunch of verbs (touched, hit, crashed ...). This is the basis for what is called “leading questions” when the question itself actually distorts the further answer. After such an experiment, there are two main ways to interpret the results. The first opportunity is that the subjects were simply not sure of their answers, and the nature of the question distorts the answers. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, suppose you are not sure whether the speed was closer to 30 or 40 miles per hour. When you hear the word “crashed”, you can subconsciously accept this as a hint that the speed was relatively high, and you answer accordingly. An alternative explanation is that the question deceives the subject’s memory itself so that it perceives the accident more destructive than in fact. In other words, when you “revise” the video in your head, the word “crashed” affects the memory of the event, enhancing the shade of this event. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If this view is correct, then the nature of the issue can actually create new additional memories around the event that coincides with the added shade. To check these explanations, the experimenters took three groups of 50 people and again showed them a video with a car accident. The first group was asked how the cars rode quickly when they “crashed” into each other. The second group is how fast when they “hit” each other.And the third, control group, was not asked at all about speed. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
After one week, the subjects returned for the next series of issues. Somewhere in the middle of the questionnaire the question was "Did you see broken glass?" In reality, there was no broken glass in the video, so it is quite reasonable to expect that very few subjects will answer yes. And that's how it was.Of the 50 subjects in the control group, only six said that they saw a broken glass. The subjects with the question containing “hit” also answered quite adequately, only with 7 out of 50 people who answered “yes” about broken glass. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But the subjects with the question containing “crashed” answered “yes” 2 times more often than the other two groups. Isn't it cool?That is, apparently, the question not only distorts further answers, but can also physically generate the corresponding memories of events that have never happened. This phenomenon is called the “misinformation effect” when misinformation after an event can integrate into a person’s memory of a real event. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And this comes from simple leading questions.Imagine what can happen if we are also placed under social pressure that distorts our memories of the event. For example, on the question of a broken glass, imagine that you must first listen to another subject, who confidently declares: “Yes, I absolutely saw a broken glass!” Such situations were also well studied in the reviewed literature, and all of them demonstrate a significant tendency to increase memory distortions through social pressure. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Well, how are these experiments applicable to these guys?Can we take their word for them when they talk about God's miracles? No.In the best case, these people simply experienced intensive emotional excitement during heavy psychological stress. If we then add a pinch of social pressure from other believers who will attribute such events to God's Providence, then we get a statistical guarantee of the addition, exclusion and distortion of important details of our memories. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That is why the evidence of eyewitnesses are everywhere considered as the weakest type of evidence. This is not because these guys consciously lie to us, in some kind of organized conspiracy, And simply because we have reliably documented mechanisms through which social pressure and disinformation can be combined to create special details of memory, without the slightest coordination with reality. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And that is not all.Remember "insufficient justification"?Even a simple act of retelling a modified story can subsequently fix and increase any distortion created by misinformation. So far, these people do not create a working model for their experience observed, and will not reproduce its effects on demand, we have no choice but to be skeptical about all personal evidence. Therefore, the next time you hear from the people of history, how they felt the power of the Holy Spirit, saw the Providence of God or participated in miraculous healings, 
</p>

<p>
then ask yourself: can I really trust the reliability of such a story?Or is this person just another naive Olukh who is not able to realize his own potential of self -deception? “One million cases of UFOs since 1947.Nevertheless, as far as we can judge, none of them are consistent with visiting the Earth by alien space ships. A huge number of people can get experiences that will be deep and strong, and yet they will have nothing to do with objective reality. ”- & nbsp; Karl & Nbsp; Sagan [Translated vk.com/id79920293]
