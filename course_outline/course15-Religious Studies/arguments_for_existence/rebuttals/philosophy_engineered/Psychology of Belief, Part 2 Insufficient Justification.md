Psychology of beliefs, part 2: insufficient justification - Another way to obtain a certificate seems amazing compared to the methods of obtaining other knowledge. We receive and strengthen the certificate, carrying it. Someone even suggested that some certificates are best received on their feet, carrying them than on the knees, begging them. In other words, we generate convictions, expressing it.

In the previous video, we learned how “information influence” leads to public conformism in the face of the pressure of the environment. In this video, we will learn how the effect called “insufficient justification” can transform public conformism into real beliefs. Consider the following experiment: Imagine that you are a volunteer in a 2-hour experiment on "measurements of performance". Your first task is to place 12 coils in the tray using only one hand. 
</p>

<p>
Great.Now pull them back. Wonderful!Now put them back. And again, pull them back. And so on... Not bored yet? For half an hour, this is all you do. Meanwhile, the guy in a laboratory robe watches everything that you make and makes notes. The next half hour is even better. You are given 48 square pegs in square holes. Using one hand, turn them all by a quarter of turn. Great!Now turn them again. And again... 
</p>

<p>
When boredom should already kill you, you are finally asked to undergo a survey. On a ten-point scale [-5.5], please evaluate the following questions: 1) Were tasks interesting and pleasant? 2) Do you think that these tasks have any scientific value? 3) Do you have a desire to participate in such experiments in the future? Obviously, the tasks were rather boring. This is the whole point: “The hour that the subject spends, working on repeating monotonous tasks, provides each subject with a unanimous experience, which he should have a negative opinion.” 
</p>

<p>
Therefore, it is not surprising that the control groups responded with rather low values. Now a little change the experimental conditions. Before giving you a questionnaire, the scientist asks you for a favor. You see, the girl in the waiting room is the next subject for the experiment. For an experiment, we need someone to give her positive ideas about the tasks. Usually we have another person who is engaged in this, but today he called and said that he was ill.

<p>
So, if you do not mind, we would like you to try to replace it. The work is quite simple. All you need to do is introduce her to the experiment. And make the following statements: 1) The experiment brought great pleasure. 2) I was very fun. 3) It was very interesting. 4) It was exciting. For this service you will be paid: Group A: $ 20.00, group B: $ 1.00 Remember, the tasks were specially designed to be monotonous and meaningless. 
</p>

<p>
Therefore, it is clear that the experimenter asks you to lie. How much does your good faith cost? You know very well that the experiment was terribly boring. And, nevertheless, you say the exact opposite. Suppose you are lucky, and you got into a group where they give $ 20.00. Of course, this will be a sufficient justification to tell a small white lie, right? Yes. That is why the group “A” also reported low indicators when a survey was held. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But what about a group with a reward of $ 1.00? How can such a brazen lies be rationalized for one miserable dollar? JUST. You begin to believe in it. When there is an insufficient justification for pronouncing lies ... ... A natural tendency is the conviction of oneself that this should be true. Even when reality looks right in the face. That is why believers are so often urged to testify to their beliefs.

<p>
“Information influence” turns “the pressure of the environment” into “public conformism”. Which supports itself, creating even more environmental pressure. While “insufficient justification” gradually turns all this into a sincere belief. So are spiritual evidence the result of the fact that God works miracles in our soul? Or is it just manifestations of our own self -deception? Say what you think.And think what you say.
