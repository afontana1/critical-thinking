title: "The Black Box of Empirical Falsification"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
Imagine how two friends, Karl and Richard, walk together in the forest in a summer day. Stopping to relax on the hemp, Karl notices a strange object nearby, almost littered with leaves and branches. After clearing garbage, both boys are surprised to find a small black wooden box. Intrigued by this discovery, they immediately begin to hypothetize about what contains a mysterious box. “I am ready to argue that this is a treasure,” says Richard, “no one will leave a box in the forest if it does not contain something very valuable.” 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But Karl does not agree: “You are wrong,” he says, “the box must contain the remains of someone else's animal.No one burns treasures anymore.This is just a little coffin. " But Richard is adamant: “It doesn't make sense at all.Who will bury their animals here in the middle of the forest?I'm sure no one! " Karl quickly begins to object to Richard: “You are just stubborn.Look around.Obviously, the burial was supposed in natural conditions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Who would not want to bury their little animals in a similar place? " However, Richard insists: “Why are you defending this?You yourself know that this is wrong?Only stolen gold has a real meaning. Thieves, obviously, wanted to leave him a little ajar so that they could easily pick it up later.We were just lucky to find him first. " But again, Karl is ready to refute: “Use reasoning,” he says, “there are a lot of good places to hide the stolen treasures that will be much more convenient. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
There is no logic in leaving the box in the middle of the forest, where random guys like us can stumble upon him.The chances are too unlikely. " For hours, Karl and Richard continue this cycle.For each argument proposed by Karl about his theory with dead animals, Richard forms a rational refutation. Then, for each logical dedication put forward by Richard, that the box must contain treasures, Karl forms a reasonable objection. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
All this time, the box itself remains unbroken. How many times have you observed a dialogue similar to this? From political debates to theological discussions, you can very often see people involved in a dialogue closely reminiscent of a scene with Karl and Richard. But it doesn’t matter how confident everyone can be in their thoughts, it should be obvious that no volumes of logical fabrications will be able to derive the contents of the box. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The box may contain a dead animal or can contain gold coins. It can even contain them at the same time.It may contain something absolutely unforeseen.Or, perhaps, nothing at all. But with all this, the final measure of the contents of the box is the box itself. Therefore, instead of spending hours behind disputes that the box should “logically, reasonably or probably” contain, A much more constructive solution will simply open the box and examine its contents directly. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Now let's look at an unexpected turn in the story with Karl and Richard. Suppose now that the box is locked, and the boys do not have tools to open it. A similar scenario is a very useful analogy for understanding the human perception of nature. For example, no one really saw a separate electron, and we cannot be “absolutely sure” that such a thing exists, not to mention how it behaves. The whole quantum theory is actually nothing more than a huge design of human imagination. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It can be a correct description of reality, or it can be completely erroneous. The world of subatomic particles abides so much outside our perception that nothing of this can be observed in some kind of direct way. Thus, it doesn’t matter how much we will try, some boxes can never be really open, and the absolute definition of reality is forever outside our reach. And what will happen to our discussion now?With a closed box, are the boys are forever doomed to argue pointless in ignorance of the true state of its contents? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Fortunately, the answer is not.Even if we cannot directly look inside the mysterious box, there are still other ways to determine its contents with a high degree of accuracy. To see how, suppose Richard raised the box and shook it. In science, we call this action “experiment”.The purpose of this action is to test the box for behavior, which is agreed with a certain explanation. If Richard is really right about the buried treasure, then the expected sound should be similar to solid metal objects ringing inside. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If Karl is right about the dead animal, then the expected sound should be the sound of a soft bag with bones rolling back and forth. Again, it is important to emphasize that the truth about the contents of the box is not a matter of logical debate and rational arguments. The decisive determinant of the contents of the box is always the box itself. The only difference is that now we cannot determine its contents with absolute accuracy. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The best thing we can hope to draw is to draw conclusions about the contents of the box, observing its behavior with directed influences. Now imagine that Richard shook the box, and both boys really heard the sound of ringing metal objects. What information is obtained from this result? Firstly, it is important to emphasize that Richard is not necessarily right about his hidden treasure. Only because the box makes ringing sounds, there is no guarantee that the box really contains gold coins. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, a box can easily contain something ordinary, such as steel bolts and nuts. Such contents will still make a sound that is agreed with a buried treasure, but it will still be far from our explanation. We can even demonstrate it physically by filling the other box with the same contents, and then observe the reaction directly. However, a similar result still informs us of something very significant. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Since the reaction was mismanced with a hypothesis of a dead animal, we can say with absolute accuracy that Karl is mistaken. This mental problem illustrates two very fundamental aspects of correct scientific thinking. The first is the idea that no theory or hypothesis can never be positively proved by the true. It doesn’t matter how zealously Richard will shake, sniff, weigh, or in other ways to explore the closed box, No many positive results will never finally demonstrate the reality of the treasure. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Without the ability to directly open the box itself, we simply cannot know exactly what really contains a box. Even if every experiment that we will ever conduct over the box will be perfectly agreed with our expectations, There is always a philosophical opportunity that some other hidden object produce the same results. All positive conclusions in science are at best indicative. The second concept that can be found from the script with the box is vital for scientific progress, but often it remains unnoticed by formulating ideas about reality. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Although we cannot know exactly what the box actually contains, we can say with absolute accuracy that the box does not contain. This concept has a name in science, and it is called “falsification” (refutability) - In order for the explanation to be considered scientific, there must be a certain test that has potential to refute the validity of this explanation. If the reaction is agreed with our expectations, then the hypothesis is simply supported. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But if the reaction is not agreed with our expectations, then the hypothesis is immediately rejected. It doesn’t matter how much sense and logic a specific explanation can carry in itself, the box itself is never mistaken, And it will reasonably coordinate our beliefs in accordance with the behavior of the box. This concept of falsification is vital for the process of generating knowledge in the real world. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Scientific theories are accepted not because they are true in any philosophical sense. Instead, they are accepted because they withstand a constant flow of attempts to refute (falsification). Therefore, even if the final theory can be fundamentally imperfect, It already shares so much in common with the truth that it loses all practical differences. When all conceivable hypotheses were rejected, something that remains should contain at least some degree of correspondence of reality. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Now let's look at the last turn in the history of Karl and Richard. Suppose for a second that the box is no longer on the ground, and instead hangs high on a tree where the boys cannot get it. Therefore, even if they develop a number of experiments that they could apply to the box, the boys physically cannot conduct them at all. In the best case, everything that they can say is that there is a box on a tree, and its contents are unknown. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But let's take another step.Suppose that, despite this obstacle, Karl still adheres to his hypothesis about the dead animal, And even gives a list of specific details about the contents of the box. “The box not only contains the dead animal,” says Karl, “but the animal itself was a three -color female named Pushistik. She was especially friendly with children, she loved when she was scratched her tummy, and her beloved toy was a ball of thread. " No matter how absurd a similar scenario sounds, it is very similar to typical human behavior in the formation of the beliefs of the “spiritual” nature. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, how often did you see people's attempts to answer difficult questions, such as "Why is there something instead of nothing?" "What happened to the big explosion?""What is a sense of life?" Despite the unverified nature of these issues, many people will be eager to intertwine a mystical deity with strange specific characteristics for response to them. For example, many Christians will tell you that a single deity, named Yahweh, not only created the universe, but did this specifically implying people as the most important goal. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Not only that, but an almighty, omnivorous, omnipotent and deeply personal. Yahweh is “he”, and not “it” and not “they”. After our death, our souls will be judged by this character Yahweh, and will be sent to places called Hell and Paradise. It is interesting that, despite these carefully detailed descriptions, there is not a single falsified experiment that could potentially refute at least one of them. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, on what empirical grounds should we conclude that Yahweh is really “he”? In addition to words recorded by potentially superstitious, biased and hallucinating people in a number of ancient texts, What observations reinforce or refute the male gender of the highest deity of the universe? In fact, all Christianity is based on nothing more than blind speculations about the contents of the box, to which you cannot even gain access. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The only thing we can say for sure is that we do not yet know what is the contents, And perhaps in the future we will eventually be able to subject the box to test. This simple analogy for today is the most important failure of all “spiritual” beliefs. Without exception, religious faith is based on the idea that unshakable confidence can be formed and supported in complete absence and even contrary to physical evidence. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And without a potentially falsified foundation on which our knowledge can be built, there is no functional difference between God, which really exists in reality, and God, who was invented from pure imagination. A box that cannot be open or tested is a box that can calmly contain anything, or is also easy to contain anything. This is a simple mathematical condition that the many imagined realities are infinitely more than many physical realities. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Accordingly, any beliefs formed in the absence of empirical severity can be immediately declared erroneous by default! Therefore, the next time you take part in a political, philosophical or theological discussion, remember the lesson of Karl and Richard - For each black box that we can encounter in life, no volumes of human thoughts, logic or intuitions, will never be able to discover the true position of reality.
