Imagine yourself standing in front of a firing platoon in anticipation of the execution. When the officer gives the command “Get ready”, and then “aim”, a platoon of well -trained shooters directs his weapons directly to your chest. A moment of silent waiting passes before you finally hear an enthusiastic cry of “FIRE!” You close your eyes and turn your head away as a deafening roar of gunfire rings out in front of you. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And yet, to your amazement, you do not feel any hits or pain. As soon as the smoke dissipates, you even look down, and see that you are completely sound.What do you think of it? Of course, there are several possible explanations.For example: Maybe someone accidentally made a mistake, replacing all ordinary bullets with idle. Of course, this is not a very probable scenario, but he certainly explains the fact that you are still breathing. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
He also has the advantage that it can be checked, because, in principle, you yourself could explore ammunition and check their quality. Now let's say you check the ammunition and it turns out to be real. Then what's next? Well, maybe your assumption of “highly qualified” arrows is completely incorrect, and in fact they are just a bunch of incompetent boobs, which never shot in life from weapons. Again, it is not very likely, but this has an explanatory force with the potential for the tested predictions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Well, then you check their skill, and they are really competent soldiers.And now? Well, maybe the arrows did not want to be responsible for human death, and therefore they all deliberately missed. Or maybe the gust of wind threw the sand to everyone in the face, as soon as the order "Fire!" Or maybe all this is just a bright conscious dream, and you still need a few minutes to wake up and recover. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
There are many possible explanations of the fact that you are still breathing, and there are well -established rules for checking the reliability of each of them. Finally, if someone suggests that an invisible, transcendental, incorporeal mind personally intervened and saved you in the last second, Telekinatically reflecting all the bullets with one magical power of will? How likely is this explanation? How would you even check it? Because if you are a Christian apologist, this should be the most convincing explanation of all. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And this leads us to the repetition of the persistent and stubborn philosophical failure of Christian apologetics: The idea that the scientific inability to properly explain the unlikely event is automatically the basis for attracting magical intervention. Only this time it is called the “teleological argument” in favor of the existence of God, and usually it sounds like this: “Here is a simple generalization of a teleological argument based on a fine setting of the universe. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The prerequisite 1: The subtle setting of the Universe is due to either physical necessity or accident or design. 2: It is not due to physical necessity or chance. 3: Therefore, it is due to design. And, of course, God is the best explanation for this design, so God must exist. The next big cosmic mystery is a problem known as “Fine Tuning”: The idea that the physical constants of nature should lie within the limits of astronomically accurate tolerances that life in our Universe be possible. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This, of course, is a confusing puzzle that puts many truly smart people, But Christians burst again, as if they have all the answers to one of the deepest secrets in modern cosmology. And, according to the rooted tradition, they do not offer anything more for discussing, except for the painful flow of failure logic, moving directly to the pre -set goal of their prejudices. For example, let's assume that we generously decide to immediately completely agree with the teleological argument without objections. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And now?How will we act further?What predictive power does he give? What experimental measurements can we take to test it? What decisions can I now make in the real world with real empirical consequences that will appear when expectations about the divine, space designer? This is precisely the final measures of truth when we make “synthetic judgments”, and not the ability to formulate cool rhetorical arguments. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But, of course, the apologists have nothing to answer to all this, and they will often even say that to demand such things from them is generally groundless! This is a complete confession and proof that the teleological argument is nothing more than an embellished philosophical crutch designed to infer God without demonstrating him. Remember that Christians ultimately try to prove the existence of essence with virtually unlimited cosmic force - literally the ability to construct a whole universe and all physical laws that control it, according to completely arbitrary whims. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
However, the very concept of “thin setting” implies a creature that is fundamentally limited by a strict set of physical laws - A creature whose creation potential is limited exclusively by a simple switching of a small set of constants, large -scale factors and initial conditions. And even then, the best thing that can obviously do this creature is to create an all -consuming abyss of hostile emptiness, In some places, dotted with balls of hot plasma and scattered gas. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Life, in all this "great plan" is a slight cosmic belated idea; A thin film of organic chemistry, smeared on the surface of a tiny, inconspicuous stone point hiding in some distant corner of the galaxy. The very idea of a deliberately designed universe is glaring absurd, When less than one of the 10^50 final product is actually capable of maintaining the very thing for which this product was supposedly originally “designed”! It would be like a multi -billion dollar oil refinery that produces millions of tons of waste every day, but only one functional gasoline molecule in a millennium. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This argument itself is an argument for a shamefully weak and incompetent deity. It is important to understand that whenever physicists speak of a “cosmic thin setup”, This means not only specifically for life, but in fact for everything else in the entire famous universe. One small change in the necessary fundamental constant - and not only life disappears, but also stars, galaxies, planets, and sometimes even stable atomic nuclei. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The phrase “thinly tuned to life” itself could be easily replaced with the phrase “thinly tuned for black holes”, And the whole design of the teleological argument would still be just as valid. In fact, even more!Because the Universe definitely spends much more time and energy on creating black holes than to create life. The most terrible fact that, step by step, the entire design of the thin setting continues to really refute, is even more terrible for apologists. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, an “electrical and scale” is often used to represent a classic case of an apparent “thin configuration”, since small deviations in its current value would sharply stop the synthesis of heavy elements in the stars. However, this prerequisite is also based on an assumption in which an electric laundry scale is the only parameter that can be adjusted at a given time. If you allow other parameters to change simultaneously with it, then in fact, you can theoretically demonstrate a whole bunch of perfectly functional universes in the complete absence of weak nuclear interaction. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Note that we have not even looked at the prerequisites for the argument itself properly, but the whole structure is already hopelessly frail, even without even starting. But let's be in good logicians and in any case we will study the course of thoughts, just to see how much it is actually perverted. And, of course, with the very first prerequisite, we see a classic logical mistake known as “false trichotomy” - The unfounded assertion that subtle setting can be efficiently explained by only one of the three exceptional philosophical options. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Since Physical Necessity we have the idea that all universal constants are the product of some mathematical singularity; an example would be the area of ​​a triangle or the value of pi. For example, the law of Kulon has this strange coefficient 2 contained in the degree of its reverse member. Change it to the coefficient, say, 3 or 1.5, and suddenly the atoms will cease to stay together. However, we also know for sure that this little factor of 2 is nothing more than an expression of how the surface area over a spherical shell is exactly proportional to the square of its radius. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The so -called “thin setting” actually has nothing to do with it, because the basic Euclid geometry simply does not allow anything else. Further, “accident” is the idea that all universal constants are nothing more than random variables, evenly distributed according to some arbitrary interval. Then, in some way, the type of game in cosmic darts blindly, our universe simply accidentally fell into the only set of constants compatible with the life of a clean, dull luck. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In fact, this is not as insane as it sounds, given that nature does such things constantly. For example, we consider the successful orbit of the Earth in the narrow “zone of inhabited” of our Sun. Any closer and life will die because the heat will eventually evaporate all the liquid water into the atmosphere. A little further, and all life will sharply freeze due to lack of energy. Well, so what?Only one of our galaxy is 300 billion stars! With such chances, it should not be surprising if it turns out that millions and millions of planets fall precisely within the limits of their inhabited zones. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Again, the so -called “thin setting” is actually simply an expression of pure probability that acts in large numbers. Finally, our last option is "Design", meaning that the disembodied mind is outside of space and time He used his inter -spatial divine magic to establish all our universal constants directly into the singularity of a large explosion. Why would he do this? Who the hell knows? But, apparently, this is somehow connected with the need to ensure that the hot balls of burning hydrogen produce stable nuclear synthesis in their nuclei, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
then ejecting heavy atomic elements in supernova explosions and dispersing their remains throughout space. For what purpose, you ask?Because, obviously, he then needs a tiny share of these heavy elements to unite them again into a small rocky planet, which allows ensuring self -reproduction of carbon -based molecules, which, after billions of years of hereditary allele variations and periodic mass extinctions, will eventually produce bipedal primates with the requisite capacity for interdependent social dynamics and personal spiritual commitment. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Is it not strange that we have many real examples of the first two options that occur in nature constantly, but there is absolutely no third option that we can talk about? And why should we do this? It's a ridiculous Frankenstein's monster with no sane motive or rationale for it from any engineering standpoint. And note that this argument completely ignores any potential philosophical alternatives, such as, possibly, a mixture of chance and physical laws working together. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, one cosmological theory suggests that with a collapse of a black hole, a completely new universe arises, which has its own unique set of physical constants. Universes favorable for the formation of black holes, therefore, also tend to generate even more universes and even more black holes. Since the conditions for black holes are already necessarily similar to those required for life, then it makes perfect sense that humans like us would eventually emerge as a byproduct of the whole process. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Or, even better.Who said that universal constants are generally constants? For example, recent observations of the constant of the subtle structure showed a potential variation, which extends from one end of the cosmos to the other. So, as far as we know, perhaps nature simply accepts all possible values continuously in space and time. Or, damn it, maybe a thin setting is really a design product, but not a supernatural design. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Honestly, why should “design” automatically imply a divine agent, and not a bunch of smart aliens with very cool technologies? But who are we deceiving?Everyone knows that Christian apologists will rather tear their eyes to themselves than to believe in the inter -spatial race of space engineers. Therefore, let's stop walking around the bush and just rewrite the first premise on the merits: "Either a subtle setting is a deliberate product of the only deity of classical monotheism, or not." This is the real dichotomy contained in this argument, so we may well accept it as it is. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And you know what?There is nothing wrong with this!This is a completely reasonable judgment that logically complies with the "law of the excluded third." All Christians now have to do is demonstrate a positive experiential manifestation of God that reasonably justifies the rejection of the Null Hypothesis. You might think that this would be a completely simple burden for apologists, given the gratily arrogant confidence that they all share in their common position. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And yet, for some strange reason, this is the only philosophical burden that they all together uniformly refuse to ever suffer. You can even see it right here in the second premise.Not the slightest effort is spent on reinforcing the hypothesis of God, Instead, the premise is completely dedicated to the rejection of any naturalistic explanation. For example, we already know that multiverse theories easily explain the thin settings, simply postulating the extensive ensemble of random universes, Each of which has its own unique mixture of initial conditions and physical constants. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
However, the apologist will immediately rightly indicate that all these theories are based solely on purely theoretical speculation and dubious metaphysical assumptions, Without the slightest hint of empirical evidence confirming any of this. But then, in one breath, apologists will immediately affirm their own speculative, dubious and unverified hypothesis as the only viable option that should be accepted -As if a simple property of other theories to be wrong, automatically means that some alternative theory becomes correct. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It is like appearing to the court on charges of murder, and the only proof that the accusation can offer in favor of your guilt is a simple fact that other people have not committed this crime. Let's not forget that in the context of Synthetic Judgments, it is virtually impossible to philosophically "prove" a negative statement. Even Christians themselves will be the first to remind us of this fact when some atheist dares to suggest that we can know with certainty that God does not exist. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Nevertheless, here we have one of the five main arguments in favor of the existence of God, completely based on the same mistake — that absolutely no unguided naturalistic explanation could ever explain fine-tuning, so God gets the win by default. So, in the end, a teleological argument in favor of the existence of God is just another argument; Words spilled into the air, without any evidence base in sensory experience or consistent logic. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Again he offers no testable predictions; he makes ridiculously absurd assumptions; he constructs a false trichotomy; He is trying to prove the negative;He ignores precedents;He limits his own deity; and he hypocritically rejects alternative theories because of the same flaws contained in his own conclusion. The only reason that people generally find him convincing is that he uses the same psychological manipulation tools that we saw earlier with Kalam.

Just start by telling the subject about a deep cosmic riddle, thereby awakening his strong sense of "need for cognitive completeness." This, in turn, will make the subject susceptible to the “effect of championship”, which is then easily satisfied with general appeals to a reasonable agent. As soon as the subject is indocrined in the right belief, the observation of the observations are then piled with abundant layers, while any potential refutation by testable empirical predictions is simply dismissed out of hand.
