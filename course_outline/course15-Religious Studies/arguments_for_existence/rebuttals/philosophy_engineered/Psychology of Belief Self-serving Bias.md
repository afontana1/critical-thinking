Psychology of beliefs: Switching distortion - We must strengthen our children, inspiring them to determine ourselves with our growing evidence, Not only their recognition in sciences, sports and other educational activities. - Carefully listen to the fact that the Word of God speaks of the essence of who you are, your identity. - The Bible says you belong to the king.- & nbsp; you are a king of the king.- & nbsp; you are the apostle of the king. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
- Show us your new formation in Christ!- Show us your true identity! - Give us your true identity! If I asked you to define yourself, how will you do it?What personal qualities come to mind? Will you say about your birth place?Or experiences from childhood? Will you mention your nationality and country? Perhaps your education and personal merits?Or food, music and entertainment that you like? These are absolutely natural and healthy ways to determine yourself in a normal social environment. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But what happens when people begin to determine their identity itself in terms of personal beliefs and beliefs? Is this a healthy way of considering yourself?What happens to our rational objectivity when physical evidence contradict these beliefs? Consider the following experiment. Suppose I have provided you with a detailed scientific study on the effect of caffeine’s health.[False research] After reading this study, you find that, according to several years of experimental studies, caffeine was directly related to the so-called fibrous-acid disease. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The symptoms of this disease include painful tumors that develop in the female breast, and as a result can lead to breast cancer. Therefore, women are strongly recommended to avoid caffeine use in any form. Obviously, this is a serious and strong statement.Conclusions may not be perfect, But, as far as you can judge, it was well backed up by high standards of convincing physical evidence. Therefore, it will be completely rational to accept the truth as it is, and modify our beliefs in accordance with this. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This conclusion is even more significant for any women who drink a lot of coffee, because they are at risk due to such behavior. So how effective is this information for the conviction of subjects? Let's start by questioning women who do not drink coffee. On a scale of 1 to 9, how convinced you are in connection between the use of caffeine and a fibrous-acid disease in women? Since those who do not drink coffee do not use a lot of caffeine, it is reasonable to assume that they lose almost nothing and do not benefit from this study. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, it is not surprising when women who do not drink coffee give indicators at 6.2. Now let's change the conditions a little. Let's ask women again, but this time we will confine ourselves to active consumers of coffee, drinking many cups of coffee per day. Now we have a group of subjects who have personal selfish interests in this study. If a scientific study is really justified, then this means that a pleasant daily ritual is a source of potentially dangerous carcinogen. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Obviously, health is an important aspect of our life, so it looks absolutely rational to expect from subjects to treat science seriously and be ready to refuse coffee, right? Wrong!Oddly enough, the completely opposite turned out to be true. Subjects with personal interests in the results of the caffeine study were actually less convinced by the data than the control group. This is a symptom of a phenomenon called “self -serving distortion” - this is when people have a strong natural tendency to interpret the information in such a way as to unreasonably please their egoism. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
As a result, subjects tend to deny completely reasonable information, simply because it has negative consequences for their personal beliefs and behavior. In the same way, subjects will be tended to accept information that has positive consequences, even if this information is not binned and unconvincing. In extreme cases, all this can lead to the “reverse result effect”, when conflicting evidence will only support self -serving beliefs, instead of their weakening. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This effect is so powerful that it can overpower other ubiquitous distortions, such as “persistence of persuasion”. So how does all this relate to the issues of faith? Have you ever noticed that religion is something more than just a set of things that people believe in, and literally a way of life. It is like an all -determining identity that gives purpose and social status. She determines people in terms of the righteous crusade against the dark forces of evil and sin. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
She calms them with the idea of deep personal relationships with a transcendental cosmic deity. But let's look in the face of facts, religious beliefs are not entirely rational. For example, in order to rightfully call yourself a Christian, you must believe that 2000 years ago The virgin gave birth to a demigod half-chirring, who then performed miracles and redeemed our sins through the ritual bloody sacrifice in order to propitiate the infinite justice of his omnipotent god-father. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Then he was crucified by the Roman authorities to resurrect from the dead, like a new one, and go to heaven in all of his heavenly glory. And it so happened that all this information was thoroughly translated and combined without errors, for decades after what happened through a number of completely unbiased, politically neutral group decisions. If any of this story is erroneous, then Christianity is another invented myth, like other religions in the world. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
- This is faith.“But why is faith right?”Why is the conviction of something right without evidence? - I don't like where it goes.I do not know what this documentary is about, but I don't like where you are going. You begin to refute my God, and this is a problem. I'm leaving, you do what you want, but I'm leaving. - I just ask questions. So what happens when Christians are faced with the prospect that the foundation of their personal identity is an absolute invention? After all, all existing historical evidence for these extraordinary events is a pure and arbitrary “I said” human narratives. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Literally copies from copies of secondary reports on physically impossible events from a superstitious illiterate culture. This cannot be a rational basis for convinction of anything.But this is not important, because Christians do everything possible to combine these stories with their own personality. Cognitive distortions are already influencing even under the most ideal conditions, but now we are talking about what determines the essence of who these people are. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It makes no difference how you can provide rational arguments when the conclusion itself is a direct threat of the cultural identity of a person. That is why religious organizations are so hard to inspire such a strong sense of spiritual identity to their followers, and especially young impressionable children. When this is achieved, it ceases to matter how correct or wrong any dogma will be. The very thought of abandoning its religion is reliably transformed into the psychological equivalent of cutting off your hand or leg. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Any attempt to avert such people from their faith by virtue of this is perceived as a direct personalized attack. From believers, one cannot expect a slight abandonment of their faith at a purely intellectual level. That is why almost every modern atheist who left his religion was able to do this only after an intense emotional crisis. The process itself requires a complete revision of the very essence of who you are as a person. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This means abandoning the attractive idea that the whole universe was created personally for you. That all these years of evidence, donations and missionary, all were part of the utopian dream of salvation of mankind. This means that you, as a person, are not even close to the righteous and intellectually justified as you always considered yourself. With such a comprehensive scale of damage to their self-perception, this is an absolute miracle that in general someone is able to leave religion. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
So, given the super -borous nature of spiritual beliefs, how can we convince people to overcome our egoism, and carefully weigh physical evidence in a rational and objectively way? This is not an easy task, but there is at least one method, the performance of which was demonstrated. Before you get involved in any intellectual disputes on sensitive topics, people need to recall that their personal identity is based on other things, in addition to the dictatorship of an ancient book. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This means that we need to emphasize that life outside religion still has a goal and joy. That it is possible to be a good and worthy person who leaves a positive impact on the lives of others. That the mind is more important than conviction, status or conformism. This process even has the name: "self -affirmation" - When beliefs are successfully separated from the personality, the subjects become much more ready to apply the correct thinking, faced with physical evidence. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, when subjects were simply reminded of the positive qualities of their social identity, Then they evaluated their readiness to accept the connection between caffeine and breast cancer three points higher.This is even more than not drinking coffee. Therefore, the next time you enter into active discussions about the reality of someone’s spiritual beliefs, remember that religion is a determining characteristic of the personality of many people. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
When something threatens these beliefs, the natural psychological reaction of a person lies in the fact that he will be closed into any excuse that will retain positive social identity. Even if you are right, even if you have an absolutely perfect epistemological justification of your position about God, atheism or evolution, believers rarely bend under the dictate of harsh cold logic. Therefore, instead of useless battles in confrontation disputes with them, try to focus their attention on a new form of identity, which nothing can threaten under any conditions at all. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Namely, in the search for truth, through empirical skeptical rationalism. Only by separating our beliefs from our personality, we can hope to abandon our precious traditions, in favor of the observed evidence and reasonable logic. - Jesus, you are the reason I live in this world.When I think about what you did for me, oh yes, I know that you are the reason I live why.I want to know you more every day.God, please open my eyes, show me your path.
