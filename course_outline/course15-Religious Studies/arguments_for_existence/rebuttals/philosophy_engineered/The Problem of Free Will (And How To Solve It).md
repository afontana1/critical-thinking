title: "The Problem of Free Will (And How To Solve It)"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
Imagine that you are sitting in the jury at a court hearing over an evil pirate beard. Looking at the list of accusations, you see his terrifying career. Robberies, robberies, extortion, rape, abduction, murder ... The list goes and goes. But besides this, the defendant does not even deny his actions at all. He immediately admits to all crimes to the last, plus in a few more, which were not even on the list. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This seems to be an exemplary and extremely unambiguous case, except for an unusual statement in defense. “Please do not put me in jail!- says Captain Beard, - I had no choice! You see, many years ago the Canadian government installed a microchip into my brain and forced me to do these terrible things. In fact, it was not me who committed these terrifying crimes.It was an organization that controlled me through the implant.I was only a limp puppet in all this nightmare. " Some kind of nonsense, you think.This is a very implausible statement!He does not think that we will really believe in it? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
However, this whole story is confirmed. Protection provides a number of CTC-slopes, which clearly demonstrate the presence of the device implanted into its prefrontal bark. Then the chip itself is provided as evidence of what a number of expert testimonies from neurologists, psychologists and electric engineers, who explain in detail how all this works in detail. Even representatives of the Canadian government testified and openly admitted that they abducted their citizens and implanted them devices to control the mind. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
All this was part of the super -secret spy project, which went awry. Ask yourself, if there are such evidence, what specific decision will you make? Will you vote “guilty” and throw the accused to prison until the end of his life?Or will you justify him for all charges? If you look like most people, then evidence in such a scenario will most likely convince you to justify him. After all, it really was not the accused who did all these terrible things, but the chip operator to control the mind. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, it looks completely reasonable to conclude that the accused did not act in accordance with his free will And therefore, he does not bear any moral responsibility for his crimes. Now, to be honest, a full -fledged “chip for monitoring the mind” is a very fantastic idea. But in reality, there are real judicial cases that are very reminiscent of this particular scenario. At least one classic example is a case of a virginya person who developed strong pedophilian inclinations after the growth of a tumor in his right orbitophroning bark. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
However, instead of direct coercion of it to action, this tumor gave rise to a riot of antisocial desires, while blocking part of the brain responsible for controlling the motives. Fortunately, when the tumor was surgically removed, the accused eventually recovered to normal social behavior. Therefore, ask yourself now what your voice would be if you were a jury in his court? Would you vote “not guilty” or “guilty”? Again, if you look like most people, then most likely you would vote “not guilty”, and this is what happened in this particular case. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But how far such thinking can reasonably spread? For example, that if for each piracy act a whole million dollars was donated to the Red Cross and used to save a hundred lives? Therefore, being perfectly moral agent, Captain Beard had no choice but to make several acts of less evil for a much greater good. Or, even better, that if Captain Beard just enjoys so much that he is a pirate, that absolutely nothing else in his life can bring him happiness? Or what if Captain Beard once began to engage in piracy simply because he became bored on Sunday after dinner? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
At what point do we move from complete merciful forgiveness to the normal use of criminal justice? These simple mental experiments are the foundation for the centuries of the well -known principle of the so -called “free will”. This is a classic problem that philosophers have been warmly discussing for thousands of years. And still she continues to give rise to disputes until today. But despite the sea of ink, written on this topic, it is surprisingly rarely possible to find someone with a comprehensive solution that really works. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And this is a real shame, because it is not so difficult to provide workable answers to such questions. All that is required is a little desire to explore the problem honestly, plus intellectual discipline for the application of strict standards of logical consistency. That is why I personally find this problem so amazing, and why I think that you all will like with me to solve the problem of free will once and for all. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Before we start, it is important to understand that the fundamental problem with such an idea as free will has very little in common with whether it existed at all. Instead, a much more serious problem, is it the best way to initially determine this term? It is as if we are all with a certain deep intuitive feeling that free will should mean But apparently, we simply cannot specify it with any solid measurable terms. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is a huge gap that undermines almost every targeted consideration of this problem. Because what is the point of entering the discussion when no one can even agree, what should there be a discussion about? Therefore, before we generally affect the practical problems of free will, it is very important to stop and ask ourselves: “What exactly do these two words really mean?” To help answer this question, just imagine yourself sitting in the room at the table. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Opposite you are two identical twins. They look the same, they behave the same, and in all physical relationships they seem as similar as two people can at all. However, there is one key difference that shares them. One of these creatures has free will, and the other does not have. Your task is to find out where who is, and do it with reproduced and reliable stability. Ask yourself, what specifically do you determine the difference? What observations will you make?What experiments will you do? What empirically verified difference do we have to look for in order to determine the difference between a creature with free will and a creature that does not have it. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Keep in your head that no matter what answer you gave to this question, in fact, it will be your definition for free will. This is the exemplary application of a well -known principle called "verificationism", And it is a fundamental basis on which the whole human language works. This is a wonderful philosophical instrument that miraculously helps to cut through pseudo -intellectual garbage, and get to the very essence of such complex ideas. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
To illustrate, suppose someone wants to tell you: “Free will is an intangible construct!And therefore, it cannot be detected or measured using empirical methods of science! ” Well, you can think so, but this immediately leads to a flagrant problem. When Captain Beard says: "I acted not according to my free will!"And then the accusation says: "No, you acted absolutely on it!" - Let me ask how exactly we can determine who is right?Will we accidentally guess? We announce that one side always tells the truth no matter what? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Because at the moment when we reject the use of any objectively checked criteria, the only way to solve such disputes is a pure arbitrary “I said so”. Microchip in the brain?Sorry, this is an empirically checked sign. How about a tumor in the brain?No!This is also checked, which means material.And there can be absolutely nothing to do with free will. Obviously, any attempts to circumvent verificationism are nothing more than a philosophical impasse. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But despite this, an obvious restriction, you simply cannot be imposed from people with clear definitions! And this is outrageous, because it means that any attempts to unambiguously indicate the free will of a solid definition, They will inevitably meet with accusations of a “straw stuffed scarecrow” from any corner of the Internet! Nevertheless, we must start somewhere, and there are at least several popular definitions that provide a working structure for verification and analysis. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
One statement in particular, which constantly pops up is the famous expression that free will is inextricably represented by "the ability to act differently." What exactly does this mean open to some interpretations, but this almost always includes an open denial of predetermination (determinism). This is a classical philosophical point of view, known as “Libertarian free will” or “metaphysical libertarianism”. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And this position means that free agents are not necessarily limited by the initial conditions of circumstances when making decisions. To demonstrate how it works from the point of view of verificationism, just imagine that our twins were given a choice between chocolate and vanilla milk cocktails. After a long and thorough reflection, they eventually come to the conclusion that they prefer the chocolate taste of a milk cocktail, and accordingly they choose it. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But suppose for a minute that there is a magic rewind button that can turn back the time. Absolutely every elementary particle in the universe, including those that are our brains themselves, will be returned to where it was at a certain moment in the past. If we then click this button and reproduce our experiment with a chocolate and vanilla cocktail, then what results do we expect to observe? According to most schools of thought, a twin without free will must steadily choose a chocolate cocktail every time. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
However, for the twin that has a free will, there is a certain probability that sometimes he can simply decide to take a vanilla cocktail. This description can sound a little stupid, but this is really the basic course of thoughts produced by the vast majority of thinkers on this topic. They do not make any attempts at all to tell you what in reality the free will is, but only tell you, which free will is not. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
First of all, that free will is not something that can logically coexist with the deterministic universe. Thus, it is believed that these two ideas are incompatible. Obviously, there are very serious problems with this point of view that needs to be considered. To begin with, there are no magic rewinding buttons that can be uniting the entire universe. Therefore, the difference between a creature with a free will and a creature without it is completely immeasurable. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Again, when Captain Beard claims that he did not act in accordance with his free will, then how exactly should we check such a statement? Do we really need a real literal “time machine” through which you can observe its actions?! And how many times should we look at how he repeats his crimes before we make sure that his actions were pre -tested? Obviously, there will never be such an opportunity.And it does not even make sense to try. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The past is the past.And no creature can “act differently” in the situation that has already been done in any way. Therefore, free will in this particular sense is absolutely failure, not even taking the first step. Nevertheless, we cannot simply justify all the criminals because of some subtle philosophical nuance, right? Only because the popular concept of free will does not make sense, does this mean that automatically everything in this idea is absolutely useless and not applicable? Of course not.For example, instead of rewinding the time itself, that if we simply reproduce the initial conditions of a certain last experiment 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And then we will observe the repetition of the results in the future? It turns out that this is a much more efficient idea, because it is what we really can produce in the real world. And this is also an exemplary definition of “determinism”, according to any modern theory of probability. So that I do not have to rewind the entire universe, But in principle, I can simply reproduce all the significant conditions that gave rise to a certain event. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If our universe is really deterministic, then for any physical experiment that you will ever conduct I can predict and reproduce the result of this experiment with perfect consistency. It also means that in all practical relationships, your future can be “carved in stone”, Because any implemented result will always be causally determined by previous conditions. So, with such a slightly changed definition, can it be concluded that people have free will?Or how? In short, most likely not.After all, if our solutions are simply a product of neural connections in our brain, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Then, in principle, I can restart these conditions, and watch how you repeat the absolutely the same solutions in a certain scenario. Or, in the same way, if I know the specific position of all neural connections in your brain, then I could, in principle, precisely predict how you will behave when providing a choice. One of the most impressive demonstrations of this principle was recently published by neurophysiologists at the Max Institute Planck in Germany. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Using the functional magnetic resonance visualization, subjects were scanned by the subjects when they arbitrarily pressed the buttons with the right or left index finger. On the subsequent analysis of the data, it was found that decisions can indeed be predicted with more than 50% accuracy as much as 10 seconds before the subject of the subject. Not a very pleasant consequence of this is that with sufficient computing power and scanning resolution, even human behavior itself can be predicted with the same accuracy as any other natural phenomenon. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For many, this usually entails very crushing conclusions for the idea of free will, and specifically for the entire concept of criminal justice. After all, if each decision made by us is simply the result of physical interactions in the atomic structure of our brains, then how particularly this differs from a script with a microchip? Captain Beard “chose” to commit his crimes, nothing more than a laptop “chose” to follow his programming. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And since we do not throw laptops into prison for improper behavior, what's the point of doing the same with criminals? However, if we could hypothetically rewind the initial conditions, and observe it as a beard “acts differently”, then most people will usually decide that he should bear moral responsibility for making incorrect decisions. Fortunately for Libertarians, there is at least one ray of hope, lurking deep in the bowels of modern physics. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
To see how it works, just imagine what will happen if a single neutron is freely released into an empty space. At first, we will observe only a lonely Subatoma particle flying alone with constant speed. However, if we wait for enough time, then we will eventually observe the phenomenon of the so-called “neutron beta-deck” - In which neutron spontaneously turns into a proton, electron and neutrino. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If we then repeat this experiment many times, we will eventually see that exactly half of the transformations occur in 10.3 minutes or less, and the other half takes more time. Almost all of this does not apply to the case, with the exception of one main detail. It doesn’t matter how perfectly the initial conditions are reproduced, we will never be able to accurately reproduce a particular moment of the individual decay of the neutron. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
No matter how hard we try, it will always be a matter of pure uncontrolled probability. Nothing concrete causes this phenomenon, and this is the fundamental property of nature itself that subatomic particles behave in a similar way. This is the famous principle called the “Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics”, and this is a very well -known interpretation among physicists today. This means that if our brains are fundamentally composed of atoms, and the behavior of atoms is not preeminated, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is based on this, human behavior itself should thus contain some non-meterminated elements in which free will can be hidden. This may sound a little mad at first, but this is a really popular argument promoted by scientists and philosophers today. And this is strange, because the Copenhagen interpretation is not very popular among modern physicists. Although this interpretation is taught in many educational institutions, everyone openly admits that it is a logical and philosophical mess. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
There are many alternative interpretations that may have advantages, And this is only a matter of time, before someone eventually demonstrates a clear empirical difference. We can say that we really simply accept the Copenhagen interpretation out of respect for tradition, instead of any strict observance of philosophical economy (razor of Occam). However, if you ignore this, a real problem with this point of view is that it seems to give “free will” to absolutely pre -programmed machines. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
To see how, imagine a simple robot that chooses milk cocktails in accordance with the decay of free neutrons. If the neutron breaks up in 10 minutes or less, then a chocolate cocktail is selected, if longer, then the vanilla is selected. In all practical relations, the behavior of this robot will look absolutely the same as that of the alleged free twin, When no reproduction of the original conditions will never give the perfect reproduction of the results as a result. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
However, we clearly see that there is nothing “free” in this design, because the robot is still just worth its program. And since your own state of the brain is fundamentally moving similar atomic interactions, your mind is most likely just a embellished version of exactly the same machine! However, if it was not convincing enough, then think about it as follows. Imagine that you were offered a choice between your favorite taste of a milk cocktail and a large bunch of dog excrement. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In principle, you might think that a person will always choose a cocktail every time, because cocktails are tasty and delightful, and dog excrement is disgusting and poisonous. But if Libertarian free will really exists, then we must expect that at least in some rare cases You will somehow feel like an inexplicable traction to literally eat shit! And when you are asked why you did it at all, the only explanation that you can, in principle, give, is that some incomprehensible motivation overpowered your rationality and made you do this contrary to all reasonable reasons. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is not very similar to the actions of the "free" agent, do not you think? And in what logical sense will we achieve anything, punishing someone for such behavior? Thus, no matter how we look at this, the idea of Libertarian free will simply does not work! By definition, libertarianism cannot coexist with determinism, and by definition, the opposite of determinism is a pure fucking accident! All this stupid dispute between determinism and free will is nothing more than a distraction of attention. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
None of the situations gives us satisfactory descriptions of how a morally responsible agent should behave, And no situation gives a reasonable model for the use of criminal justice. Therefore, it is not surprising that Libertarian free will is probably one of the most rejected ideas in the history of academic philosophy. However, for some strange reason, the vast majority of disputes on this topic are still focused on contrasting, which does not matter at all in any case! It is as if everyone is so obsessed with the solution of the issue of determinism that they never stop thinking what an alternative script does something better? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Keep in your head that everything that we are really trying to do here is to determine the word! Libertarianism is just one of the possible definitions for free will, and there are still many other definitions that we have not yet studied. But it is important to always remember that there is no such thing as an objectively “correct” definition. There are only “good” definitions and “bad” definitions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Good definitions are clear, consistent, laconic and usually cover an intuitive understanding that we usually associate with these terms. Bad definitions are obscure, unverifiable, confusing or logically absurd in their application. Metaphysical libertarianism is nothing more than just a bad definition, because it cannot be realized into something effective and practical. If this means that free will is absolutely dead in your understanding from now on and forever, then okay. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We recognize this all together: free will does not exist !!!And what has changed from this? But we still have to deal with the fact that crimes exist in this world, and we cannot expect to cope with them properly without a working concept of moral responsibility. For this purpose, philosophers have developed all kinds of alternatives for libertarianism, aggregatedly known as "compatibilism" -The idea that any free will in our understanding is still logically compatible with the deterministic and/or random universe. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is a wide variety of competing theories, and we can spend the clock, analyzing worthy applicants. But instead of stagnation in an endless cycle of even more poor definitions, Let's dwell for a second and ask ourselves why free will care so much? In other words, when we say people like Captain Beard, to imprisonment, then what exactly are we trying to achieve this? What is the goal here?What consequences are we trying to implement through an act of punishment that cannot be achieved if it is simply released? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
You will be amazed at how difficult it is to find any outstanding philosopher in history, who at least approached the solution of such issues. As if we are all so superior on the meager details of free will that almost no one ever stopped to ask ourselves, what is the meaning of this? And this is amazing, because it seems to be not some kind of deep philosophical secret of the millennium. According to any official legal doctrine of the entire Western world, there are specifically five reasons for punishing criminal behavior. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Starting from the number one, we have a “restoration” doctrine (compensation, restoration, smoothing of harm) - This is the idea that the punishment exists to eliminate and compensate for any harm that was caused by a specific action. For example, when you go back by car and run on a neighboring mailbox, Then at least one form of punishment will consist of simple compensation for any harm and inconvenience. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
At number two, we have a “suppression” doctrine (deterrence, warning) -The tendency of people to refrain from certain types of behavior if they are convinced that this will prevent any undesirable consequences. For example, everyone knows that speeding is usually dangerous, but the temptation to do it can also be very strong. Therefore, in order to reduce the likelihood that people will ride too quickly, for the sake of their own safety, we made a limit to the speed of cars And then a moderate penalty was set for the identified speed excess. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Moving to number three, we have a doctrine of “rehabilitation” (re -education, correction) - The tendency of people to modify their future behavior after personal testing the effects of punishment. For example, maybe you do not believe that some segment of the route is really observed, and you decide that you will get off speed excess. However, if you were caught and fined, then the conviction of the punishment is restored, and you will be much more likely to follow the rules in the future. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Further, at number four, we see the doctrine of "restrictions on legal capacity" - The need for the complete deprivation of some people of methods and opportunities for committing certain crimes. For example, imagine that your vision has worsened, and each time you begin to ride like a maniac when you drive. If no number of fines prevents you from violation of the rules, then in the end it becomes reasonable to simply completely take away the driver’s license and the ability to use the car. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Finally, at number five, we have a doctrine of "retaliation" - Sensual satisfaction provided to society when it sees how bad people suffer. When you exceed the speed, it means that there should be something inherent to the evil in you, which simply deserves to be punished. Therefore, we impose fines on you simply for the sake of the goal itself to harm you. You may notice that the doctrine of retaliation is flagrantly inappropriate in this list. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
When all other doctrines serve as clear pragmatic goals, the latter is essentially institutionalized revenge. Even the word itself literally means “retribution” in Latin. When you harm society, society is inclined to get angry with it, And the only way to reassure this anger is apparently causing some kind of proportional harm to you. Therefore, it is not surprising that retaliation and libertarian free will almost always go hand in hand. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They relate to good and evil as magical forces woven into the fabric of space and time. And only the actions of metaphysically “free” agents are somehow able to shift this subtle universal balance. That is why retaliation “upon coincidence” The most controversial doctrine of criminal punishment for today. Philosophers and lawyers around the world constantly write about the absurdity of this doctrine, And only because of the banal institutional inertia, it still remains an official part of the criminal justice system today. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Note also that if we just forget about retaliation, then the remaining four doctrines are all perfectly compatible with deterministic assumptions. They welcome the idea that today's actions will inevitably lead to predictable human decisions tomorrow. This is a great pragmatic system with demonstrated social advantages, What does it mean that we will continue to punish people in any case whether there is a libertarian free will or not. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
So why not just clench your teeth and use this as our foundation to determine free will, Since it is obvious that this is already an actual foundation for our entire system of criminal justice for today. For example, imagine our two identical twins again, and offer them a choice between chocolate and vanilla cocktail. All other things being equal, you should expect that both twins will choose chocolate instead of vanilla, and do this constantly when repeating the experiment. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But now imagine what will happen if we try to convince the twins to choose vanilla. For example, we can try to bribe them, beg, beg, threaten anything. Just let them understand that the actions adopted in the present will have positive or negative consequences in the future. In the case of a twin who has no free will, no awards or punishments will never change his behavior. You can offer him a million dollars or physically beat him to the loss of feelings, but he will always choose chocolate, no matter what. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In the case of a twin that has a free will, there will be a distinct threshold of award and/or punishment that will change his behavior. He can succumb to beliefs and choose Vanil instead of chocolate. Rightly speaking, we are not obliged to determine the free will in specifically these terms, and perhaps there are dozens of other formulations that will be more strict. This is not the point.The bottom line is that free will is already so strongly intertwined with the ideas of punishment and moral responsibility, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
that we could already use them as a foundation for a working definition. There is no need to put any magic buttons for rewinding the entire universe, When we can easily achieve a perfectly satisfactory result, simply observing the natural consequences of awarding and punishment. For example, take a classic script for the court session with Pirate Captain Beard. Should we punish him or justify it?To answer this, just ask yourself whether the imposition of punishment can prevent the future criminal behavior in similar circumstances? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In other words, if I punish Captain Beard for his crimes, can I expect this punishment will prevent him and other agents from committing piracy in the future? For a special case with devices to control the mind, the answer is obviously not! No awards or punishment will prevent anyone from committing a crime when they have a real microchip in their brain, which forces them to do this in any case. However, if Captain Beard took up piracy one fine day simply because he became bored, Then there are all reasons to expect that the imposition of severe punishment will effectively prevent other bored people from following a similar path. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, we will say that the brain chip is definitely depriving people of their free will, and ordinary boredom on Sunday after lunch is not. This is an extremely clear distinction that is substantial and practical, and it does not require involving any stupid metaphysical delirium. Note that we can immediately answer all kinds of unusual philosophical questions through the application of this foundation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, you ever wondered why we do not bring our animals to the same extent moral responsibility as people? For example, if my cat goes to the toilet in a wrong place, why do we not punish him as a person who would commit the same crime? With compatibilism, the answer is very simple. Although I can train my cat to use a cat toilet through the competent use of awards and punishments. But I cannot warn cat crimes, conducting demonstrative condemnations of cats. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is because the key ingredient for free will is the ability to complex rational thinking in a wider social context. It makes no sense to prevent the criminal behavior of those who are intellectually not able to project someone else's example on themselves. Therefore, it is absolutely fair to say that our animals possess some elements of free will to varying degrees, But even close to the same scale as us people do not reach. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And what about robots?What will be required in order to finally declare that some artificially designed robot officially crossed the singularity and developed its own free will? Again, it is easy to answer this question while we consistently apply the definition. At what point can the reward or punishment warn or stimulate certain behavior? To illustrate, imagine a possible world where its own Robot-Dvoretsky is preinstalled in every house. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Now imagine that for some reason our butler sometimes behave in a strange way. For example, maybe they break our dishes or rearrange the furniture while we sleep. In a normal situation, we simply adjust the malfunction by identifying the defective lines of the code, and upgrade them properly. However, in the future there may not be a code that can be corrected. Most machine learning algorithms are today not based on pure repeating logic, but on neural networks, displayed from the functions of adaptability based on the primary experience of the environment. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Then, if we want to adjust the incorrect behavior of our robots, maybe we really will have to train them through the use of award and punishment. And if it happens that our robots reached a level when they can study on each other's experience, then we will not have to train them each individually to achieve the desired result. Instead, we can take a separate robot, and make a public sight from his punishment. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>

If this action leads to a real prevention of future improper behavior, then we officially satisfy our definition of free will. And why not?In all practical senses, this is exactly how we control human social behavior now, Therefore, it makes sense to describe the hypothetical community of robots in completely the same terms.

But you cannot replace something that works, nothing that does not work. Metaphysical libertarianism cannot help you in this situation or any other.And compatibilism can.
