Psychology of beliefs, part 5: submission techniques - Let's check it.Do you think you observe 10 commandments?- & nbsp; well, I do not think that I know all 10 commandments, but I'm sure ... - What can you call?-& nbsp; do not steal, do not kill ...-& nbsp; well, come on one at a time, have you ever killed someone?- & nbsp; no. -Have you hated someone?- & nbsp; yes.- & nbsp; the Bible says that the one who hates his brother is the killer, so you committed the murder in your heart.- & nbsp; Yeah. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If I asked you directly: "Are you a killer in your heart?"What would your answer be? And how will the simple fact affect your answer that somewhere at some point in your life did you feel hatred towards another person? Is this really making you a real killer?No, of course not. The idea is absurd without a doubt. So what convinced this person in this dialogue willingly agree with accusations of murder? Consider the following experiment. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Suppose that on the morning of Monday you get a call from a person who represents the California Consumer Group. He calls because he would like to know if you would have agreed to participate in a study on various household products that you use every day. All he needs is 2 hours of your time and free access to your house, Where a group of 5-6 people will flow in your things and will conduct an inventory. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Obviously, this is a wildly intervention request, therefore it is not surprising that only 22% of the subjects agreed to participate in this study. Now let's change the conditions a little. Suppose that instead of hoping in your things, the researcher asks you to answer several simple questions on the phone about what brand of soap you use to clean the kitchen. This is not so bad, right?You answer a few questions, thanks for your time, that's all. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
3 days later, a person calls you again and asks to participate in the next study. All he needs is 2 hours of your time and free access to your house, where a group of 5-6 people rummages in your things and will conduct an inventory. In all respects, this is absolutely the same unreasonable request as before. The only difference is that now, three days before, she was preceded by your consent to answer the simplest questions about soap. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Of course, such an insignificant excuse will have no effect on submission, right? Wrong!The simplest act of establishing minor consent has more than doubled the success of the success of the intervention request! This is the basis for the so -called "leg in the door" - The probability of obtaining subordination to any request increases greatly, when the consent to a shorter action is first ensured.

-& nbsp; did you steal something?- & nbsp; yes, it was.- & nbsp; And what is the name of the one who steals?- & nbsp; thief.[Ensuring & nbsp; small & nbsp; consent ...] -& nbsp; that is, you stole, you hated someone, that is, you committed the murder in your heart;Did you lie to anyone? - Yes, definitely;[Another little agreement ...] I think we, like people, have ever committed all these features;I am not saying that I am making them now.[The subject still has doubts ...] - & nbsp; how many times have you lied in your life?- & nbsp; I probably do not get involved, hehhyx.- & nbsp; that is, a lot?Well, how do you call the one that lies?- & nbsp; a liar, usually. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
“So you are a false thief?”- & nbsp; Of course, Hahaha. - That is, here is a quick generalization: Chris, in your own admission, you are a false thief, blasphemy, adults, a harlot and a killer in the heart. Let's look at another experiment. Suppose you are a freshman of the faculty of psychology. As a task for receiving additional points, you were invited to participate in an experiment on “thought processes”. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
All you have to do is to come in a great time - at 7 in the morning - for lesson.Easy to be simple, right? No, of course not.Very rarely, any student will get himself out of bed by 7 in the morning only for a few miserable additional points. Therefore, it is not surprising that only 24% of students eventually obeyed. Now let's change the conditions a little. Instead of being honest about unreasonable time, suppose that we will first ensure verbal consent to participate in an additional lesson before saying that it will be at 7 in the morning. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Again, in all respects, this is absolutely the same request as before, but with a small rearrangement in the sequence of information. Of course, such a meager detail will not give rise to submission to the 7th hourly experiment, right? Wrong!The initial establishment of verbal consent has practically doubled to 53% subsequent submission to the request to appear at 7 in the morning. This is the basis of the so -called technique of "throwing a low ball" - The probability of obtaining subordination to the request may increase sharply if you just wait for the consent before disclosing hidden costs. 
</p>

<p>
Let's look at another experiment. Suppose you came to the home baking fair and stumbled upon the following offer: One kexik and two cookies at a very low price of $ 0.75.Sounds like a wonderful deal, right? Therefore, it is not surprising that 40% of the subjects agreed to this deal. Now let's change the conditions a little.Suppose you come across the following sentence: One cupcake for $ 0.75.And, no, a second, I was mistaken.This is one cupcake and plus two cookies for $ 0.75! Again, this is completely the same proposal.The only difference is that I artificially inflated the profitability of the sentence, starting with a single cake, and then added cookies to it. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Of course, no one will be so stupid as to buy for such a cheap trick, right? Now you already guess what will happen.After a simple offer, the cookies, in addition to Kexik, agreed to the deal. This is the basis of the so -called technique "But this is not all!" - When the probability of submission increases greatly, simply through artificial inflating of the perceived value of the sentence. At this stage, one painful fact begins to be extremely obvious, namely: people are boobs! And I'm not only talking about children and grannies.This applies to everyone. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
You, I, your neighbors, your friends, your family, that's it! Each of us is an Oluch to varying degrees. Even worse, these techniques are only a small sample of various methods with which people can manipulate the subordination of their lovers. Anyone who consciously uses such techniques is simply a seller who is trying to sell something. So how do these studies apply to the issues of faith?Is this really such a person who shares valuable knowledge who has evidence -based justification in reality? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Or is this person no more than a cunning seller trying to generate belief through methods that are well known to impose submission by their power? And what does this say about this poor man?Was this guy really conquered by the power of the goddessed word? Or is he just another Olukh, who has become a victim of an exemplary psychological manipulation? “Finding a rare straw of truth, washed by the ocean of delusions and deception, requires smartness, vigilance, determination and courage. 
</p>

But if we do not practice these difficult thinking skills, then we cannot even dream of solving the truly serious problems facing us - and we risk becoming the Society of Olukhov, vulnerable to any first counterclaim. ”- & nbsp; Karl Sagan [Translated vk.com/id79920293]
