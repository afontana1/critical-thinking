title: "What is Truth"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
If I had to name the only most frustrating aspect of modern popular debate, then it will definitely be frankly adversarial in which all of them, apparently, occur. Instead of working together on building a better understanding of our world, We, apparently, are more focused on making philosophical points against the “opposition”. Often this is even originally conceived, for example, as in trial, when both lawyers must dogmatically defend the best interests of their customers. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
However, the rest of the time, apparently, this happens spontaneously, As if no one really knows the rules when he takes part in this process. That is why so many philosophical debates in our world are felt very similar to a game of chess against an opponent who thinks that it should be checkers. Without any formal agreement on what truth is and how to recognize the truth, when we observe it, there can simply be no way to productively interact with the opposite points of view. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For me, this creates a very strong incentive to just sit down and in detail explore the question "What is truth?" Because in the context of philosophical and mathematical logic, in fact, there are already very well -founded answers to this question. You just most likely did not know about this, because, apparently, no one managed to clearly specify them in a single and comprehensive format. That is why I feel personally motivated to present my results on this problem. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is a great opportunity to build a foundation in detail for the basic epistemology so that everyone can see it, And so that we all can finally bear mutual responsibility for a more strict set of philosophical rules. To begin with, it is important to understand that every time we talk about such a thing as “truth”, we are not talking about some integral metaphysical property of reality itself. In fact, in reality we are talking about the property of judgments. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In other words, judgments can be both false and true, but there is no such thing as "the primary essence of truth, woven into the fabric of space and time." Speaking more formally, the “meaning of truth” is classically defined as a member of a binary set containing elements “truth” and “lies”. The purpose of this set is to perform the function of a certain marking for linguistic judgments to help us measure their epistemological correctness. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
What exactly means this remains open to some interpretation, but we can give this a strict definition through a mechanism known as the “purpose of truth”. Again, formally, the purpose of truth is defined as a function of comparison between many simple linguistic judgments and many binary values of truth. If it sounds too technically at first, then just think about it as follows: Imagine that I wrote a simple judgment on a leaf and put it in front of you. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In your left hand you have a large seal with the inscription "Truth", and in your right hand there is a different large seal with the inscription "False". Your task is to solve what seal deserves to be put on this leaflet. Therefore, ask yourself how will you do it? Will you just arbitrarily put prints randomly?Or will you apply some kind of set of rules that will give your seals a more significant meaning? Whatever answer you give to this question - this will be your function of appointing truth. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is an algorithm that takes simple linguistic judgments at the entrance and then determines the binary value of truth at the output. Now let's go further.Suppose that you stamped a dozen of these leaves with the values of truth, and suddenly you feel that you need to put them together in more complex structures. For example, perhaps you think that two true judgments of the connected from left to right, also need to be printed with the meaning of “truth”. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Or you think that two false judgments connected from top to bottom should always be “false”. Maybe you think that the judgments marked with the “truth” on the front side, everyone should be marked with a “lie” on the reverse and vice versa. All these are absolutely valid operations, and they express the role of “logical ligaments” contained in the field of “logic of statements”. We love to use logical ligaments, because they allow us to literally bind judgments together, thus creating more interesting formulas of judgments. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Note also as nothing physically forces us to hold on only a binary set of meanings of truth. For example, perhaps you think that the truth will have much more sense if we use a triple set of meanings, instead of binary. This is an absolutely valid concept that is even used today in practice by scientists, engineers and mathematicians. Some logic systems even consider the truth as a continuum of meanings, instead of a discrete set, and again, this finds the application in many areas of science. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
There is no objectively correct or incorrect answer, except for the collective consent of people-philosophers, in our most important desire to find a reasonable concept of truth. All this is still quite standard material, and it can be easily confirmed in most textbooks on the subject. Nevertheless, what you usually cannot find is an official position regarding the exact nature of the ideal purpose of truth. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
As if we are all experts in manipulating the values of truth, as soon as we have them, but no one knows how to initially prescribe these values of truth. This is a real shame, because this issue is the essence of the fact that the idea of truth should philosophically embody. In the best case, we have only a vague idea that the truth should, in one way or another, represent a certain “correspondence” between a set of linguistic judgments and the actual state of things in objective reality. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
True judgments are those that effectively describe the real world as it is, and there are no false judgments. This is a fairly common epistemological concept, which philosophers quite accurately called the "correspondent theory of truth" (theory of conformity). And at first glance, this seems to be a completely intuitive definition. Unfortunately, in this idea there is a gaping hole that requires solution. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Namely, what specifically means this “correspondence” that we are talking about, and how can I recognize it when I observe it? For example, consider a simple linguistic judgment as a “round moon”. Is this truth or is it a lie?Because, according to the theory of conformity, the most reasonable thing we can say is: "If the moon is round, then this is the truth that the moon is round." Since it is obvious that this is an empty tautology, the theory of conformity in reality did not tell me anything about how to prescribe truth for judgments. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But let's go even further.What if I get up on the street one evening and just look at the moon directly with my own eyes? Thus, if I see a more or less round object, then I can reasonably say that the moon is round, right? In general, no. For example, if some optical illusion caused by the atmosphere makes square objects just seem round? Or what if I just look at the giant photograph of the moon?Or for some complex hologram? Maybe all this is a hallucination caused by drugs?Or, perhaps, a very realistic conscious dream? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Maybe I was misleaded by a magical demon?Or maybe I'm really just a brain in a bank connected to some "matrix"? I just don't know that.And, moreover, I basically cannot find out. No volume of reflection and evidence will never allow me to accurately determine the objective reality as it really is. The correspondent theory of truth for this reason is useless, because it does not imply a way to distinguish between all these competing scenarios. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, if we are going to achieve progress in building an effective epistemology, then we must take into account the basic restrictions that nature gave us. This is a fundamental philosophical concept, known as the “egocentric position” or equivalent to the “problem of skepticism in relation to the outside world”. And all that this means is that for any sensory perception that you can ever experience, there may be countless arbitrary explanations about the reasons that cause it. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Do not forget that I am just a feeling agent locked in my momentary mental awareness, I can’t just get out of this awareness, and directly perceive the reality as it really is. And even if I could, how exactly can I find a correspondence between linguistic judgments and these objective data? What rules should I follow and how can I apply them? We simply cannot ignore the fundamental barriers that exist between reality, our perception of reality and our linguistic framework to describe reality. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
At this moment, many philosophers begin to fit strongly with each other, but there are at least a few general principles with which most people are usually ready to agree. For example, one theory of truth, which has great usefulness, is known as the principle of “mental incorrigibility” or simply “empiricism”. Everything that he says is that any honest statement about momentary sensory perception is automatically a true judgment. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, we present a simple judgment, for example, "I feel pain in my left leg." Even if it turns out that this is a complete illusion, for example, amputation with a severe case of a phantom limb syndrome, I still can’t deny the fact that I really feel a distinct sensory perception, which is unique among many others. Therefore, it looks completely reasonable to simply recognize our sensual data as they are, to identify this experience with linguistic landmarks, and then prescribe the basic meanings of the truth to these judgments accordingly. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Another popular system for prescribing truth for judgments is called “axiomatic formalism” or in the context of this discussion “rationalism”. In fact, this system says that certain “obvious” judgments called “axioms” deserve a special importance of truth initially. For example, take the reflexive law of equality: a = a No one deduced this judgment from some more basic logical systems, as he did not find it empirically, hiding under some kind of stone. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This was simply declared directly as a “truth”, because mathematicians need an equality concept from which you can build a working algebra system. When we finally agreed on the issue with the right set of axioms, then it becomes possible to generate new true judgments from the old ones, applying something called the “conclusion rules”. For example, one classic example of the Rules for the conclusion is the “transitive law of equality”: if a = b and b = c then a = c Again, no one deduced this rule from some deeper foundation, and it was also not empirically discovered. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This was simply announced as an action that we can do with the concept of quantitative equality, maintaining truth. Any new judgments generated in this way are called “theorems” and represent a deep driving force in all the logic of judgments and mathematical logic. This may seem like a strange circular thinking at first glance, and in all justice it is in a certain sense. Nevertheless, contrary to popular misconceptions, axiomatic systems, as mathematics and logic, do not make attempts to describe any objective understanding of reality, independent of the mind. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Rather, it is much more correct to think about such systems, as the form of a highly formalized language. Good axiomatic statements in this case are actually not so much circular as they are definitional (depending on the definitions). That is why all logical and mathematical theorems are “analytical judgments” in nature. Such truths are exclusively derived from the initial values that we set on these terms, and not from any direct connection that they can have with the outside world. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Someone can even say that this makes analytical judgments a certain formal continuation of “incorrigible” judgments, since any internally free to determine their own dictionary, as he likes. But how are things with the so -called “synthetic judgments”, which are actually trying to describe objective reality? In other words, the world “outside”, outside the borders of purely mental processes? For example, we consider the judgment “all the bachelors are bald” or maybe “all dogs live on earth”.How can I appoint truth for judgments from this category? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Again, I can’t just open a can with reality and directly observe the facts of being outside my sensations. Also, I cannot logically derive their truth from any assigned meaning for the words themselves.Then what to do? This is a part where everything can seem very confusing, partially because there are many diverse and strange methods for assigning truth, for any choice, and there is no real “official” answer. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, imagine that we decided to prescribe truth to judgments that simply reinforce our sense of personal identity or social status. We will call this "selfish justification." Perhaps this is not a very good system, but this is still an absolutely valid function that operates within the framework of clearly defined rules. Perhaps you yourself even encountered such a system, for example, in religious or political debate, where personal emotions are usually very high. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Another interesting class of synthetic prescriptions of truth is called “biblical infallibility”. And she simply says that no true judgment can never contradict the records contained in the Holy Christian Bible. In general, this is a very common purpose of truth, usually arising in religious fundamentalist organizations. Truth, in their vision, is, in fact, everything that the Bible says. Although there is an obvious desire to criticize the biased approach contained in such a definition, it is difficult to ignore the clear and full distinction that makes this definition. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But let's look in the face of the facts.These purposes of truth are obviously arbitrary and completely unsatisfactory, Because they do not make any attempts to philosophically combine our beliefs with an objective reality that is independent of our mind. So far, we will not be able to find a way to overcome the egocentric position imposed on us by nature, no system of purpose of truth will have a reasonable advantage. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That is why so many philosophical debates in our world seem so meaningless. Most functions of the purpose of the truth used in practice are either unreasonably arbitrary, blatant self -serving, or deliberately stupid. To solve this problem, I think that you need to take a step back and ask yourself a fundamental question about the truth, which is surprisingly few philosophers ever asked. Namely: why is it so damn important to believe in as many “true” judgments as possible, as far as possible, and at the same time reject as many “false” as possible? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
What is the difference from this in the end? For example, imagine a hypothetical world in which everything that I am convinced of the Universe constantly turns out to be categorically “false”. Nevertheless, absolutely every time I make a decision based on these beliefs, the consequences are always as predictable as possible and desirable for me in any case. Similarly, every time I put into action any “true” belief, the outcome never turns out to be predictable or desired for me in general. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Now, let's ask ourselves, in such a world does it make sense to call any beliefs “false” at all? And if so, then why should I ever want to believe in anything “true”? I can spend my whole life, being absolutely wrong with absolutely everything, and it will only be good for me. This simple mental experiment reflects the fundamental principle of a system for prescribing truth, widely known as “pragmatism”. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Everything that this system says is that the only significant reason is why someone bothers to believe in anything, so that in the end we can use this information to guide to our actions. Decisions made on the basis of true beliefs will subsequently manifest themselves in the form of a controlled, predictable experience, And decisions, adopted on the basis of false beliefs, eventually cannot achieve this goal. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Any beliefs that do not lead to any actions, at least hypothetically, respectively are recognized as a useless, empty chatter. To illustrate how this system can work in practice, just imagine yourself standing at a dangerous intersection, and you suddenly decide to cross the road. Of course, you can axiomatically declare prerequisites and logical conclusions as much as you want, But sooner or later you will have to implement this information in the real action. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, even if you think that you very smartly picked up your intellectual prerequisites and sophisticated rhetoric, I have not yet encountered any philosopher who could successfully argue with the bus at full speed. Therefore, each and at any time uniformly tied to the same pragmatic process in their daily epistemology. 1. We collect empirical data.2. We formulate them as a rationally descriptive model of objective reality. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
3. We implement decisions in accordance with this.4. And then we empirically observe the result. If our understanding of the behavior of the road is really “true”, then we can expect a safe intersection of the street without incidents. However, if our model contains errors or contradictions, then this is just a matter of time before we eventually fall under the car. This is what makes pragmatism the only epistemology with at least some meaningful and effective “attachment” to the outside world outside our sensations. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Because even if all my reality is nothing more than a “matrix” or a demon of a demon, Even this reality is still objectively real and apparently functions in accordance with causal patterns. Therefore, “just in case”, if my actions have at least some influence on the outcome of future events, Then I can use these outcomes to get real information about the laws that control my reality. Beliefs control actions.Actions have consequences.And the consequences are objective. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We can give this process a cool technically sounding name, for example, “pragmatic empirical rationalism”. But in reality, this is just a embellished way to say “science”. Because, indeed, this is all that science is fundamentally reduced to fundamentally - a formalized system of collecting empirical data, their expressions in rational, predictive models, And then testing these predictions for a quantitative assessment of actions and consequences. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We like to establish our beliefs on scientific methods, because they ultimately allow us to make real decisions in the real world with real, empirical consequences. Mental incorrigibility and axiomatic formalism is not just an end in itself, but the necessary tools to achieve the most important goal of pragmatic orientation in the world. Also pay attention to how the pragmatic model covers many other well -known principles of science and scientific method. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, we consider the principle of “pharmacy” (error), which simply claims that no synthetic model of judgments can never be assigned the meaning of “truth” with any perfect, final reliability. In the best case, we only know what to expect from such models, if and when we build them. Therefore, all allegations about knowledge of objective reality should always remain open for a possible revision when colliding with new and better information. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Moreover, the principle of “falsification” (refutability) states that we can with complete validity to assign the “false” value to some models. This is because the very definition of a false model of judgments suggests that this is such a model, the empirical predictions of which do not come true. Similarly, we can even use pragmatism to quantify the principle of “razor of Occam”: In the presence of two models of judgments that make completely equivalent predictions, a model containing less assumptions is automatically preferable. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Because, if both models are empirically equivalent in any case, then you can simply choose the one that requires less work for reflection. But hey, maybe this is too self -confident.Maybe you think that pragmatism is a terrible principle of assigning truth, and that we all must replace it with some kind of “highest” form of understanding. But let's clarify that this entails. Without any of the pragmatic goal, with the help of which our beliefs could be measured, They are actually disconnected from any empirically predictable decision that we could ever hope to make. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, I could openly recognize all your judgments about reality to the last, and literally nothing in my life would have changed as a result of this. That is why no one is worried about how many angels can dance on a pin head. Any answer that we will give will certainly be insignificant and meaningless. However, we are very worried about which drugs are best for treating cancer and why. This is because any decisions that we can hope to make on this issue necessarily depend on our final answers. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, if your purpose of truth cannot somehow realize my desire to solve real problems and reliably predict the results of my actions, then, by definition and recognition, it is irrelevant and useless. Thus, the pragmatic scientific method is the final measure of all philosophical truth. [Translated vk.com/id79920293]
