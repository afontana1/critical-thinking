title: "Top 5 Philosophical Failures of Christian Apologetics"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
I welcome everyone and welcome again. I would like to discuss today what I consider frequent philosophical failures that I constantly encounter when I interact with Christian apologists. And you also need to know about them so that you learn to recognize them when they come up. As I previously said many, many times on my channel, debates about the existence of God, that is, the cultural war between American Christianity and secularism -This is something more than some debate between academic or political authorities. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
When I get to the real deep philosophical essence of this problem, I constantly find a philosophical battle for how the “truth” itself should be determined and realized. And in one camp we have people, like myself, whom we can describe as “pragmatic empirical rationalists”, In other words, people who based their beliefs on such things as physical evidence, logical formalism and, as a result, functional decision -making and solving problems. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But, when it comes to Christian apologists, their goal in reality is not in the generation of functional knowledge, but in the imposition of conformism. That is why we constantly see so many appeals to authority, arguments from personal distrust and the operation of cognitive distortions. And when these two camps meet each other in public debate, the result is very similar to watching a chess game against an opponent who thinks that this is actually checkers. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Instead of engaging in a rational analysis of facts and evidence, to achieve predictable results, Instead, we are fighting on how to generally determine the philosophical “truth” of anything. For example, many of you undoubtedly know about the recent debate between Bill Holy and Ken Ham about evolution. What would be to be a mutual presentation of evidence within the framework of biological models of a variety of life, Instead, there was something like a tiring passage through a philosophical swamp. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In my opinion, this is a wonderful demonstration of why it is impossible to have rational debate with Christian apologists. Because Christian apologists are simply not interested in playing the rules of rationality initially. They are not worried about which biological models are more efficient to create tested empirical predictions, Because the tested empirical predictions do not play almost any role in their epistemology. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For you and for me, this means that if we seriously want to change the way that Christians think about the nature of God and religion, then we will never be able to convince them with rational empirical arguments. Instead, if we really want to achieve progress in the long run, we must completely restructure all their understanding of epistemology and philosophical assumptions. Thus, in an attempt to help everyone to have more productive discussions, I will list the fact that I believe “TOP 5 philosophical failures”, which must be voiced before anyone hopes to conduct a rational discussion with a religious believers. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Because, if we do not solve these things fundamentally from the very beginning, then everything else that we will discuss further will simply be the next game of chess against the opponent who thinks that it should be checkers. Well, holding it in my head, let's start with number 5, which is “the inability to recognize the analytical and synthetic difference”. To understand what we mean by this, we will consider the following judgments: The first - "all bachelors are not married."And the second - "all bachelors live on earth." 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is a classic demonstration of the principle that philosophers call the "analytical-synthetic difference." The first judgment is essentially simply a statement of meaning and definitions built into the language itself. The second judgment is a statement about the relationship between the actual things in the physical world. Therefore, if you want to judge the truth of these statements, you quickly find that the rules are fundamentally different. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In other words, one is different from the other.While the first statement can simply be analyzed through the pure meaning of the words themselves, The second should already be tested through empirical observations in the real world. Perhaps you will think that such a distinction should be quite obvious, especially in the light of the fact that philosophers have been talking about these things for centuries. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
However, for some reason, many and many Christians, including self-proclaimed philosophy experts, actually experience very great difficulties in applying this. For example, perhaps you have encountered the infamous tactics of bringing to the point of absurdity, which is a common rhetorical technique that Christians love to play. And usually this begins with a typical atheistic statement that says something like: "In order to justify the conviction of the existence of God, empirical scientific evidence in support of this convinction is first necessary." 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Well, this is a completely reasonable statement.To which Christians then answer: “But then what are your scientific evidence that science is true, huh?Shah and Mat, atheists! ” In other words, the task in itself, apparently, supposedly should be unreasonable or self-verifying. The problem with this tactic is that science is not a statement about the outside world. Science is a process.We people have determined science through the use of analytical judgments, And then we use science to evaluate the truth of synthetic judgments. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, if it so happened that you like science and philosophical goals that science seeks to realize, then excellent - go and do science. And if you do not like science as a process for building knowledge, then fine, then do not do science. But it is important to understand that science itself is automatically not a subject for the rules of science itself. This will be a mixture of analytical and synthetic judgments. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Another excellent example of such philosophical confusion, in my opinion, is an “ontological argument” in favor of the existence of God. This argument is trying to show that just the very concept of God is already enough to logically prove that God exists. But again, this is a mixture of analytical and synthetic judgments. Logic, like science, is a process. That the logic seeks to achieve is to establish certain rules for reasonable comparison and comparison of the information contained in judgments. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
However, pure logic in itself cannot magically generate reliable facts about the outside world through the definitions alone. This is just not what she does.Therefore, it does not matter how logical Christians consider themselves, Because the ontological argument in itself is philosophically not able to achieve the thing for which it is invented. Synthetic judgments cannot be dedicated only through pure ideas. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They should be attached to any empirical predictive model, otherwise they are simply functionally useless. Moving further to the philosophical failure number 4, we have a "general obsession with Platonism." In a very broad sense, “Platonism” is the idea that abstract objects have a real literal existence in themselves, regardless of human thought. For example, we spoke several times earlier about entities like numbers. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
You cannot see the numbers, you cannot feel them, you cannot hold the number in your hand, but they definitely have real strength to describe the world. Therefore, if you are a platonist, then, in your opinion, the reason for this is that these numbers are not just ideas, but real legitimate things that exist. That there really is a real extra -spatial and timeless world, where these things are “located” and carry out their impact on the physical world. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And how I tried to emphasize many times - this is not how numbers work.Even if Christians try to convince us that this is so. But when you really get to the very philosophical essence of the issue, it is easy to see that there is no such thing as a literal number. In other words, I can calmly say that I have “two” apples or “two” orange, But I can never really say that I have independent "two", on my own. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The reason for this is that the phrase of the type “two apples” is in fact just a grammatical short way for “apple and other apple”. Words like “two” and “seven” are just useful tools that allow me to express information in accordance with convenient compact formalism. Therefore, it hardly has at least some sense to think about the independent “two” in itself, because the word itself is technically not even a noun. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We simply usually do not notice this, because we usually abuse the language, speaking of the “two”, as if it were still a noun. This is only one example, but you can be surprised how often this Platonic delusion is constantly manifested in Christian philosophy. For example, how many times have you heard how Christians ask something like: “How do you, atheists, explain the universal laws of logic?” When I hear a similar challenge, it seems to me that Christians in a complete seriousness implies that logic is something like 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The integral physical essence of the Universe, somehow magically woven into the fabric of space and time. But as we already said, this is not how logic works. Remember that logic is a process.This is a set of formalized rules that we use to combine and compare judgments. If you follow the rules of logic, then you are logical. And if not, then you simply are not logical. However, we usually really like logic, because logic is a very useful system for organizing information in agreed statements of ideas that other logical people can understand. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But there really is nothing metaphysically transcendental in the axiomatic system of epistemology built into our use of the language. What now leads us to failure number 3, and these are "endless problems with internal consistency and basic sequence." You think that this is a simple principle for understanding, but it is just amazing how often Christians fail this. For example, maybe you heard the famous question "Is there absolute truth?" The answer, of course - no!Judges can be true or false if they are subject to certain axiomatic statements. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But there is no such thing as the “primary essence of truth” in itself. Therefore, to ask whether the absolute truth exists is the same sense as asking whether there is absolutely “large”. No, it does not exist.Objects can be large, or small, but the pure “big” in itself is not even what can be said about. Another excellent example of just pure inconsistency is the whole idea of God himself. In other words, we have a powerful personal agent who loves you immensely, and desperately wants to build a deep emotional connection with you, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
While at the same time, he deliberately hides his very existence from you And it will not even shake you to torture you for ages, just for the inability to believe in its correct version. Excuse me, Christians, but these are mutually incompatible parameters for one creature. If you can’t even determine God, in a meaningful, consistent and agreed form, then by default, which you would not talk about here is erroneous and cannot exist. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Moving further, we have a failure of number 2, and this: the inability to accept the “burden of evidence”. Of all the failures that I have encountered in a religious apologetics, I think this is the same depressing. Because, honestly, this idea is so simple and obvious that it is incomprehensible to the mind as people cannot understand it. In fact, this principle only says that a person who makes a positive statement is responsible for the justification of this statement. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But for some insane reason, Christian apologists are constantly fighting against this idea. Perhaps you personally came across examples of this, when Christians say "You cannot prove that God does not exist!"As if it automatically means that it exists? Or maybe you heard a statement that "there are no good arguments, that atheism is truth!"Again, as if this is some kind of destructive discovery? And, of course, the answer to this is very simple.All that you must say to a Christian is two words - "zero hypothesis." 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And your business is done.In other words, until the moment when Christians give a consistent definition of God and provide convincing physical evidence of His existence, then I will not base any decisions on the implied expectation of God. It's really that simple.However, some Christians will fight to death against this. To see why it is so depressing to explain such an obvious principle, just imagine what the world would look like if the burden of evidence was overwhelmed. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Literally, at the moment when someone comes up to you and says absolutely any statement, you will be obliged to fully believe him and act in accordance with this. And you must continue to act in accordance with this, until you show “proper” efforts and do not prove the falsity of the application. And this is provided that this statement is generally in principle falsified. Obviously, this is a very stupid and impractical lifestyle. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Each of us applies the principle of zero hypothesis on an ongoing basis, and any attempt to challenge this is equivalent to the justification of naive cautiousness! Therefore, always remember, you are not obliged to refute God, this work has already been done for you by default. The burden lies with Christians so that they provide us with convincing positive arguments, based on the tested empirical predictions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And since to this day no of their arguments has been good, none of us has any rational obligation to change our behavior in accordance with them. Finally, our first philosophical failure of Christian apologetics, are you ready? Number 1 - absolute denial of "pharmacy" (error). I put this first in the first place, because I think that this is the most ugly and egregious failure in all Christian philosophy. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In fact, everything that means pharmacy means is that it is possible to make mistakes in something. And if it is shown that you are mistaken, then you must change your opinion on what is right. This may seem quite straightforward, and you might think that everyone agrees with this initially. But most Christian apologists actually reject this principle openly, in accordance with the doctrine! For example, we have the principle of “biblical accuracy” and “papal infallibility”. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We even saw just this insane position on the debate of Ken Ham and Bill Naya. Remember how they both asked, directly "What can change your views?" Ken Ham then publicly and valiantly stated that absolutely nothing! That the truth, by definition, is absolutely everything that the Bible says, and therefore the Bible cannot be mistaken, and Ken Ham cannot, accordingly. Just ask any of your familiar atheist "What will be required to convince you that God exists?" Most of them will most likely give the same answer that Bill Nai is evidence. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And even the most convinced of us, even the great and terrible dokins, openly stated that evidence is all that we need. If Christians simply determine God sequentially, and then provide convincing physical demonstrations of the existence of this God, Then, in fact, all of us will be happy to abandon our atheism and turn to Christianity. Now ask the same Christian apologists: "What will be required in order to convince you that God does not exist?" How do you think they will be inclined to answer?Because often they will be very straightforward about this. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Nothing!Absolutely nothing can shake their faith. As if it is philosophically impossible for them to make mistakes in their spiritual beliefs. Even when they do not say it openly, they still find ways to say it indirectly. For example, did you hear William Lane Craig spoke about the “self -confirming evidence of the Holy Spirit”? That even if all the evidence in the world turns against Christianity, then Craig would still believe, because he has a holy spirit! And of course, if nothing can outweigh this experience, then the final result is always the same - nothing can change the views of Craig. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That is why I believe that it is absolutely legitimate to say that Christian apologists are not honest people. They are not interested in improving the understanding of reality, they simply try to strengthen a priori conclusion. Therefore, please, if you ever enter into a serious religious discussion with a Christian, then first of all, make them recognize basic pharmacilism. Ask them directly: “Is it possible that you are mistaken?What should be required to convince you that you are mistaken? If you are mistaken, would you like to know about it so that you can correct your fallacy? " 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
These are questions that should be openly established, otherwise nothing of what you will say further will not affect anything at all. In conclusion, I hope you have found this presentation useful.And if you have encountered any philosophical failures, then please share them, and give examples of how they arise in your discussions with Christians. Just remember that when you enter into religious philosophical debate, then we are not talking about facts and evidence.

It's about epistemology.If you cannot fix the broken epistemology at the heart of all these beliefs, then you can never create a new rational free -thinking person. Good luck in your business and thanks for watching. [Translated vk.com/id79920293]
