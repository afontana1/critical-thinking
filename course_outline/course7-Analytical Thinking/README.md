# **Analytical Thinking Curriculum**

---

## **Unit 1 — Foundations of Analytical Thinking**

**Goal**
Introduce learners to analytical thinking as a disciplined way of approaching problems: clarifying questions, decomposing complexity, identifying assumptions, and structuring inquiry.

**Core**

* Defining analytical thinking vs critical and creative thinking.
* Problem framing and scoping.
* Structuring problems into parts and relationships.
* Clarifying terms, categories, and assumptions.
* Asking precise and operational questions.
* Distinguishing evidence, inference, and interpretation.

**Resources**

* Richard Paul & Linda Elder, *The Thinker’s Guide to Analytical Thinking.*
* George Pólya, *How to Solve It.*
* Herbert Simon, “The Structure of Ill-Structured Problems.”
* Daniel Kahneman, *Thinking, Fast and Slow* (Sections on System 2 and analytical effort).
* Edward de Bono, *Six Thinking Hats* (for structured reasoning modes).

---

## **Unit 2 — Problem Decomposition & Representation**

**Goal**
Teach students to break complex problems into manageable subproblems and represent them visually or structurally for clearer analysis.

**Core**

* Problem decomposition strategies (top-down and bottom-up).
* Concept mapping and relationship mapping.
* Process mapping and workflow visualization.
* Systems boundary identification and variable classification.
* Translating qualitative descriptions into structured representations.

**Resources**

* Joseph Novak, *Learning How to Learn* (concept mapping foundations).
* Dan Roam, *The Back of the Napkin* (visual thinking and diagramming).
* Basic BPMN and flowcharting guides.
* Articles on abstraction and representation in problem-solving.

## **Unit 3 — Computational & Algorithmic Thinking**

**Goal**
Develop algorithmic habits of thought — systematic, stepwise problem solving that draws from computer science concepts but applies broadly to reasoning and analysis.

**Core**

* Understanding problems as sequences, loops, and conditions.
* Algorithmic decomposition and procedural reasoning.
* Heuristics, optimization vs satisficing, tradeoffs, and constraints.
* Understanding computational models as conceptual tools.
* Bridging human and computational problem-solving styles.

**Resources**

* Brian Christian & Tom Griffiths, *Algorithms to Live By.*
* Jeannette Wing, “Computational Thinking” (2006).
* Melanie Mitchell, *Complexity: A Guided Tour* (selected chapters).
* Charles Petzold, *Code* (optional background reading).

## **Unit 4 — Data, Risk, and Decision Analysis**

**Goal**
Help learners analyze uncertain situations and make reasoned judgments about data, risk, and tradeoffs without requiring formal statistics.

**Core**

* Probability intuitions and cognitive biases in risk assessment.
* Decision trees and structured tradeoff reasoning.
* Expected value, utility, and thresholds for action.
* Framing uncertainty and sensitivity to assumptions.
* Data interpretation, correlation vs causation, and limitations.

**Resources**

* Howard Raiffa, *Decision Analysis: Introductory Lectures on Choices under Uncertainty.*
* Annie Duke, *Thinking in Bets.*
* Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, *Judgment under Uncertainty.*
* Nassim Nicholas Taleb, *The Black Swan.*

## **Unit 5 — Process & Systems Orientation**

**Goal**
Introduce the analytical study of systems and processes as preparation for systems and model thinking. Show how parts interact dynamically within wholes.

**Core**

* Process analysis and flow mapping.
* Feedback loops, stocks, and flows.
* Causal reasoning in dynamic systems.
* Identifying leverage points and unintended consequences.
* Boundary-setting, model scope, and simplification.

**Resources**

* Donella Meadows, *Thinking in Systems.*
* Peter Checkland, *Soft Systems Methodology in Action.*
* Charles Perrow, *Normal Accidents* (case study examples).
* Basic guides to causal loop diagramming and system mapping.

---

## **Unit 6 — Meta-Analytical Habits**

**Goal**
Cultivate reflective awareness of how one analyzes. Teach learners to monitor, critique, and improve their analytical approaches and assumptions.

**Core**

* Self-questioning and reflective diagnostics.
* Intellectual humility and open-mindedness.
* Assumption audits and robustness checks.
* Counterfactual and alternative analysis (“what else could be true?”).
* Recognizing framing effects and methodological limitations.

**Resources**

* Gary Klein, *Sources of Power.*
* Richard Rumelt, *Good Strategy/Bad Strategy.*
* Nassim Taleb, *Antifragile.*
* RAND Corporation, *Guide to Critical Thinking about What to Do in Crisis Situations.*

## **Unit 7 — Program Evaluation & Policy Analysis**

**Goal**
Teach learners how to evaluate interventions, programs, or policies using structured analytical reasoning about impact, causality, and tradeoffs—bridging micro-level analysis with societal-level applications.

**Core**

* Framing evaluation questions (“what works, for whom, under what conditions?”).
* Logic models and theories of change.
* Distinguishing outputs, outcomes, and impacts.
* Evaluation types: formative, summative, process, impact.
* Causal inference logic (counterfactual reasoning, validity threats).
* Common designs: RCTs, quasi-experiments, natural experiments (conceptual).
* Policy analysis steps: defining problems, developing options, applying criteria (effectiveness, efficiency, equity, feasibility).
* Cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit reasoning (conceptual, non-technical).
* Using evidence in decision-making; institutional and ethical constraints.
* How decision-makers use evaluation results (or don’t).
* Bridging evaluation → recommendations → real-world implementation.
* Understanding political, ethical, and institutional constraints.
* Map assumptions in evaluation designs (what has to be true for this to work?).
