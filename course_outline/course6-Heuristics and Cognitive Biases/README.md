## Reflection & Real-World Identification (use after Sections 5–12)

**What you’ll do**

* Keep a one-week “bias journal”: identify a daily decision, label plausible heuristics/biases, note evidence format, and plan a fix (e.g., translate to frequencies, check base rates, run a premortem).
* Mini-labs:

  * **Calibration clinic:** 20 prediction items with probability scores → compute Brier score, debrief as a group.
  * **Premortem sprints:** 20-minute team exercise on an upcoming assignment or project.
  * **Choice redesign:** audit a campus form/flow; propose a nudge that preserves autonomy.
* Tie-outs: “What model did you implicitly use?” (bridge to model reasoning and systems thinking).
