# Course overview: Language Ignorance and Epistemic Virtue

---

**Big question:**
How do our *character*, *language*, and *social environment* help or hinder our search for truth?

**By the end, students should be able to:**

* Distinguish epistemic *virtues* and *vices* and see how they shape inquiry.
* Analyze how metaphor, framing, and definitions structure our thinking.
* Explain what ignorance is (not just “lack of knowledge”) and how it can be produced and maintained.
* Connect cognitive science of reasoning (bias, relevance, vigilance) with everyday argument and persuasion.
* Recognize social dimensions of knowledge: testimony, trust, epistemic injustice.
* Practice metacognition and “actively open-minded thinking” as habits of intellectual character. ([PMC][1])
* **Distinguish philosophical skepticism from scientific skepticism**, and explain what each is trying to accomplish (and what can go wrong). ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][40]) ([Wikipedia][50]) ([Wikipedia][54])
* **Use skeptical tools to diagnose weak justification**, including regress/circularity/dogmatism patterns (Agrippa’s Five Modes) and context/variation-based doubt (Aenesidemus’ Ten Modes). ([Wikipedia][44]) ([Wikipedia][43])
* **Practice calibrated skepticism:** proportion confidence to evidence, separate “unproven” from “false,” and articulate what would change one’s mind (especially in public controversies and scientific claims). ([Wikipedia][50])
* **Identify unhealthy skepticism and motivated skepticism**—selective doubt, identity-protective/reactionary “skepticism,” and cynicism-as-stance—and explain how these degrade inquiry and social trust. ([Wikipedia][41]) ([Cultural Cognition][48])

## Unit 1 – Epistemic Virtue & Vice: Intellectual Character and Bullshit

**Guiding questions**

* What does it mean to be a *good knower*?
* What is bullshit, and why is it a distinct epistemic problem? ([Wikipedia][2])
* How do traits like arrogance, dogmatism, or closed-mindedness feed extremism?

**Sub-units**

1. **From traditional epistemology to virtue epistemology**

   * Knowledge as justified true belief vs. knowledge as achievement of an *epistemic agent*.
   * Reliability vs. responsibility; reliabilist vs. responsibilist virtue epistemology. ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][3])

2. **Intellectual virtues**

   * Curiosity, intellectual humility, integrity, intellectual tenacity (connect to **UCI Anteater Virtues** project). ([Anteater Virtues][4])

   * Cassam on *Vices of the Mind* and extremism: epistemic vices as explanatory tools for political phenomena. ([Amazon][5])

4. **Bullshit, assholes, and corruption of discourse**

   * Frankfurt’s definition of bullshit as *indifference to truth*, distinct from lying. ([Wikipedia][2])
   * Aaron James’ **Assholes: A Theory** and entitlement as a stable character trait. ([Wikipedia][6])
   * How these character structures damage epistemic environments (public discourse, classrooms, social media).

5. **Actively open-minded thinking (AOT)**

   * AOT as willingness to consider alternatives, seek disconfirming evidence, and revise beliefs. ([PMC][1])
   * Empirical links between AOT and better judgment, and distinction between intelligence and rationality.

## Unit 2 – Language, Metaphor, and Framing

**Guiding questions**

* How do metaphors structure thought, not just decorate it?
* How does framing make some options “thinkable” and others invisible?
* When are euphemisms and doublespeak epistemically dangerous?
* How do stories (narratives) package those frames into emotionally compelling, memorable forms?
* When are narratives epistemically helpful vs. manipulative?
* How do narratives (about self, groups, and events) organize experience and guide reasoning?

**Sub-units**

1. **Conceptual metaphor theory**

   * Lakoff & Johnson: human cognition is deeply metaphorical; we understand abstract domains (time, morality, argument, politics) through more concrete source domains (space, motion, war, family). ([Wikipedia][11])
   * How metaphors highlight some aspects of reality while hiding others.

2. **Framing and political discourse**

   * Lakoff’s work on framing, *Don’t Think of an Elephant!* ([Google Books][12])
   * Frames as “mental structures that shape the way we see the world.”
   * Competing frames for the same issue (e.g., “tax relief” vs. “public investment”).
   * “Tax relief” vs. “public investment”, “War on drugs” vs. “public health crisis”, “Illegal alien” vs. “undocumented immigrant”
   * Metaphorical framing in political discourse and its measurable effects on reasoning and policy preferences. ([Metaphorical framing][37])

3. **Euphemism, doublespeak, and pseudo-clarity**

   * William Lutz on “doublespeak” and how jargon, inflated language, and euphemism conceal reality. ([Wikipedia][13])
   * Connections to bullshit and propaganda.
   * Bullshit as indifference to truth; doublespeak as systematic manipulation of linguistic surface to obscure reality.

4. **Analogy, models, and conceptual exploration**

   * How analogies guide reasoning and discovery, but can mislead when taken too literally.
   * Practicing building and critiquing analogies for complex topics (e.g., “filter bubbles”, “herd immunity”).
   * Scientific and social analogies: “the marketplace of ideas,” “immune system,” “filter bubble,” “arms race,” “ecosystem of information.”

5. Narratives as Frames in Time

   * Jerome Bruner: narrative as a primary mode of thought; people understand their lives and social worlds through stories. ([Narrative Construction][38])
   * Narratives as temporal frames: they select beginnings, middles, and ends; identify heroes, villains, victims; assign causes and moral meanings. ([Narrative Paradigm][39])
   * Narrative coherence vs. factual accuracy: A story can “hang together” (internal coherence) yet be false. It can resonate with identity and values (“fidelity”) and thus be persuasive despite poor evidence (Walter Fisher’s narrative paradigm).

6. Narrative, Identity, and Moral Framing

   * How political and ideological movements offer powerful identity narratives (“the oppressed who rise,” “the betrayed nation,” “the silent majority”).
   * Epistemic vices like closed-mindedness and dogmatism can be embedded in a narrative that makes them feel virtuous.
   * Bruner and MacIntyre on life as narrative: The idea that a human life has “narrative unity” and that virtues and values make sense within a story about what kind of life one is trying to live.

**Core readings**

* George Lakoff & Mark Johnson, *Metaphors We Live By*. ([Wikipedia][11])
* George Lakoff, *Don’t Think of an Elephant! Know Your Values and Frame the Debate*. ([Google Books][12])

## Unit 3 – Definitions, Concepts, and Conceptual Engineering

**Guiding questions**

* What are definitions doing in arguments?
* How do lexical, stipulative, and persuasive definitions differ?
* When should we revise our concepts (“conceptual engineering”)?

**Sub-units**

1. **Types and functions of definitions**

   * Lexical vs. stipulative vs. theoretical vs. persuasive/rhetorical definitions. ([OUP Academic][15])
   * Their roles in clarifying disputes vs. smuggling in value judgments.
   * The roles of definitions: Descriptive (recording existing usage), Reforming (tidying up messy usage), Normative (building value judgments into terms), Technical (creating precision for specialized inquiry).
   * How good definitions reduce confusion and help us locate genuine disagreement.

2. **Definitions, Classification, and Argument**

   * Definitions as argumentative moves: “He’s not a real expert,” “That’s not violence,” “This doesn’t count as racism.” How re-defining a term can effectively win an argument by changing what “counts” as evidence.
   * Persuasive definitions: Definitions that smuggle value judgments into apparently neutral language (e.g., “Abortion is the murder of an unborn child”; “Patriotism is unconditional love of country”). How persuasive definitions shift the emotional and moral terrain of a debate.
   * Classification and social reality: How we carve the world at its joints (or fail to): Legal categories (“felony,” “terrorist”). Medical/psychological categories (“disorder,” “addiction”). Social labels (“gang,” “cult,” “refugee,” “illegal alien”). Classifications as gatekeepers for rights, resources, and stigma.
   * Value-ladenness of definitions: Many key concepts (person, harm, freedom, gender, disability, citizenship) are thick concepts: simultaneously descriptive and evaluative. How changing a definition can change what is seen as a problem, who is blamed, and what solutions are considered.

3. **Equivocation and definitional fallacies**

   * How shifting meanings of a term within an argument (equivocation) create illusions of validity. ([ThoughtCo][16])
   * “No true Scotsman” and “moving the goalposts” as definitional tactics.
   * Exercises in reconstructing arguments so that key terms keep a stable meaning.

4. **Conceptual analysis**

   * Frank Jackson’s defense of conceptual analysis as central to philosophical methodology. ([PhilPapers][17])
   * Traditional philosophical project of analyzing concepts by uncovering necessary and sufficient conditions.
   * Using thought experiments and counterexamples to test candidate analyses.
   * Limits of conceptual analysis: vague concepts, family resemblances, context-sensitivity.

5. **Conceptual engineering**

   * Herman Cappelen’s “fixing language”: improving our concepts to better serve epistemic and ethical aims. ([Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews][18])
   * Classroom exercise: engineer improved concepts of “conspiracy theory”, “fake news”, “expertise”, or “asshole”.
   * Evaluating concepts by their epistemic, ethical, and political effects: Do they track important distinctions? Do they unfairly stigmatize or erase groups? Do they help inquiry or obstruct it?

**Core readings**

* A good critical thinking / informal logic chapter on definitions (e.g., Moore & Parker, or Dowden’s online *Logical Reasoning* chapter). ([Quizlet][19])
* Frank Jackson, selections from *From Metaphysics to Ethics: A Defence of Conceptual Analysis* or related essays. ([Amazon][20])
* Herman Cappelen, selections from *Fixing Language: An Essay on Conceptual Engineering*. ([Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews][18])

## Unit 4 – Belief, Ignorance, and the True Believer

**Guiding questions**

* What is it to *believe* something, as opposed to hope, suspect, or imagine it?
* How can ignorance be actively *produced*?
* How do mass movements and extremism exploit epistemic vices?

**Sub-units**

1. **Propositional attitudes and norms of belief**

   * Belief vs. credence, knowledge, assumption.
   * Norms for holding beliefs (evidence, coherence, safety, etc.).

2. **Epistemologies of ignorance & agnotology**

   * Ignorance as *structured* and often politically useful; not mere absence of knowledge. ([Cambridge University Press & Assessment][21])
   * Agnotology: study of how ignorance is manufactured (e.g., climate denial, tobacco). ([Stanford University Press][22])

3. **The psychology of the “true believer”**

   * Eric Hoffer, *The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements*. ([Wikipedia][23])
   * Personality types in mass movements; self-renunciation; enemies and devils; how extremism capitalizes on epistemic needs.

4. **Extremism and the extremist mindset**

   * Cassam’s work on extremism and the “extremist mindset” as epistemically vicious. ([Routledge][24])
   * Tie back to vice epistemology and ignorance.

**Core readings**

* Eric Hoffer, *The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements*. ([Wikipedia][23])
* Robert N. Proctor & Londa Schiebinger (eds.), selections from *Agnotology: The Making and Unmaking of Ignorance*. ([Amazon][25])

## Unit 5 – The Use of Reason: Cognitive Science of Argument

**Guiding questions**

* What is reason for? Individual accuracy, or social persuasion and coordination?
* How do heuristics and biases shape everyday reasoning?
* How do we decide what someone means beyond what they literally say?
* What is relevance, and how do we track it in communication and argument?

**Sub-units**

1. **Mercier & Sperber: The enigma of reason**

   * Their thesis: reason evolved more for social argumentation than solitary truth-seeking. ([Harvard University Press][26])
   * Implications for why we’re so good at motivated reasoning but also capable of collective improvement.
   * The importance of good argumentative environments (peer criticism, norms of discourse).
   * Critical thinking as designing better contexts for reasoning, not just teaching rules.

2. **Heuristics, biases, and dual-process theory**

   * Kahneman’s System 1 vs. System 2, fast vs. slow thinking. ([Wikipedia][27])
   * Gilovich on systematic errors in everyday reasoning. ([Amazon][28])
   * Limited Cognitive Resources

3. **Grice, Implicature, and the Cooperative Principle**

   * From what is said to what is meant: Distinction between literal meaning (sentence semantics) and speaker meaning (pragmatics). Conversational implicature: what a speaker implies or suggests without explicitly stating it.
   * The cooperative principle, Gices Maxims (quantity, quality, relation, manner)
   * Understanding implicature helps students see how much of argument and persuasion happens between the lines. Ties to bullshit and doublespeak, Politicians and advertisers often rely on implicature for plausible deniability (“I never said that”).

4. **Relevance theory and pragmatics**

   * Sperber & Wilson’s *Relevance: Communication and Cognition*: communication as guided by expectations of optimal relevance. ([Monoskop][29])
   * Hearers automatically search for an interpretation that yields enough cognitive effect for reasonable processing effort. Communicators produce stimuli that they expect to be optimally relevant.
   * How “salient” or “emotionally charged” claims can dominate attention even if weaker evidentially.
   * Frames and metaphors steer what counts as relevant, what inferences feel natural.

5. **Epistemic vigilance**

   * Sperber et al.: we have cognitive mechanisms to monitor the reliability of informants and messages (checking on source and content). ([dan.sperber.fr][30])
   * How to cultivate deliberate epistemic vigilance in a media-saturated environment.
   * Source-checking, triangulating information, seeking disconfirmation.
   * Problems in modern information environments: Overload, echo chambers, and low-cost communication. Ease of manufacturing apparent credibility (bots, fake experts, aesthetic of authority).

**Core readings**

* Hugo Mercier & Dan Sperber, *The Enigma of Reason*. ([Harvard University Press][26])
* Daniel Kahneman, *Thinking, Fast and Slow*. ([Wikipedia][27])
* Thomas Gilovich, *How We Know What Isn’t So: The Fallibility of Human Reason in Everyday Life*. ([Amazon][28])

## Unit 6 – Social Epistemology, Testimony, and Epistemic Injustice

This connects your themes of ignorance & virtue with explicitly social structures of knowledge.

**Guiding questions**

* How much of what we “know” is based on what others tell us?
* What happens when people are not taken seriously as knowers?
* How do group dynamics (echo chambers, polarization, trust) shape belief?

**Sub-units**

1. **What is social epistemology?**

   * Goldman on social dimensions of knowledge, social practices that promote or hinder truth. ([FAS Philosophy Rutgers][31])

2. **Testimony, trust, and expertise**

   * When is it rational to defer to experts?
   * Criteria for evaluating testimony in science, politics, and everyday life.

3. **Epistemic injustice**

   * Miranda Fricker on testimonial and hermeneutical injustice: wronging someone *as a knower*. ([OUP Academic][32])

4. **Collective epistemology and echo chambers**

   * Group belief, group ignorance, and structural features of social media that exacerbate epistemic vices (polarization, filter bubbles). ([Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews][33])
   * Nguyen’s distinction: Epistemic bubble are a social-epistemic structure where relevant voices are simply not heard (accidental omission, homophily, filter bubbles). Echo chamber are a structure where outside voices are systematically discredited and members are taught to distrust outsiders. Echo chambers require rebuilding trust and epistemic relationships, not just adding more information.
   * Echo chambers as social epistemic structures that reshape: who counts as an authority, how evidence is interpreted, which defeaters are accepted or dismissed.

5. **Trust as an Unquestioning Attitude (C. Thi Nguyen)**

   * To trust something (a person, institution, technology) is to settle one’s mind about it, to suspend ongoing monitoring and questioning, and to rely on it “by default.”
   * Limited agents like us must adopt such unquestioning attitudes just to cope with the “cognitive onslaught” of the world.
   * When unquestioning trust is good vs. dangerous: Good when trusting basic infrastructure, calendars, competent experts, scientific institutions. Dangerous when trusting echo chambers that recruit and then exploit unquestioning trust in in-group authorities.
   * How echo chambers weaponize trust: They lower the barrier to believing in-group testimony and raise the barrier to accepting out-group testimony. Critical thinking as learning when to re-open what we’ve “settled” and subject it to scrutiny.

**Core readings**

* Alvin Goldman, *Knowledge in a Social World* or selections plus *Social Epistemology: Essential Readings*. ([FAS Philosophy Rutgers][31])
* Miranda Fricker, *Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing*. ([OUP Academic][32])
* Selected papers from *Essays in Collective Epistemology* (ed. Jennifer Lackey). ([Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews][33])

## Unit 7 – Metacognition, AOT, and Intellectual Self-Regulation

**Guiding questions**

* How do we monitor and regulate our own thinking?
* What does it mean to be *aware* of one’s cognitive limitations?
* How can we cultivate epistemic virtues in ourselves?

**Sub-units**

1. **What is metacognition?**

   * Flavell’s classic definition: thinking about one’s own thinking, monitoring and controlling cognitive processes. ([Frontiers][34])

2. **Calibration, overconfidence, and intellectual humility**

   * Why people are often overconfident; how feedback, prediction exercises, and intellectual humility improve calibration.

3. **Actively open-minded thinking revisited**

   * Bringing back AOT as a *trainable* disposition, connected to virtue epistemology and critical thinking pedagogy. ([PMC][1])

4. **Designing your epistemic character**

   * Students develop a personal “epistemic virtue profile” (strengths/weaknesses).
   * Create practice routines: e.g., “disconfirmation diary,” systematic exposure to opposing views, slow-thinking rituals for high-stakes decisions.

**Core readings**

* John Flavell, classic work on metacognition (via contemporary summaries). ([Frontiers][34])
* Keith Stanovich, work on rationality and AOT (articles or chapters). ([PMC][1])

## Unit 8 – Philosophical Skepticism: Doubt, Regress, and the Limits of Justification

**Guiding questions**

* What is philosophical skepticism, and why does it keep returning in epistemology? ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][40]) ([Wikipedia][54])
* What happens when we press “How do you know?” repeatedly—do we get knowledge, or an infinite regress?
* How can skepticism be *virtuous* (intellectual humility, carefulness) without collapsing into cynicism or nihilism?
* How do motivated forms of skepticism (selective doubt) distort inquiry and public life? ([Wikipedia][41])

**Sub-units**

1. **Skepticism as a philosophical problem (global vs. local)**

   * Global skepticism (e.g., “Do we know anything at all?”) vs. local skepticism (e.g., skepticism about testimony, induction, perception, experts).
   * Skeptical arguments as *stress-tests* for our norms of justification: closure, evidence thresholds, standards of certainty.
   * How skepticism can function as an “epistemic immune system” *or* as an “epistemic acid” that dissolves trust indiscriminately.

2. **Pyrrhonian skepticism and the therapy of suspension**

   * Pyrrhonism: skepticism as a practice—equipollence of considerations, **epochē** (suspension), and tranquility as an aim. ([Wikipedia][42])
   * Using Pyrrhonism pedagogically: “Suspend belief” ≠ “deny,” and “withhold” ≠ “don’t care.”

3. **Aenesidemus: the Ten Modes (systematic doubt about appearances and judgments)**

   * The **Ten Modes of Aenesidemus** as families of underdetermination arguments: variation across perceivers, circumstances, and conceptual schemes. ([Wikipedia][43])
   * Classroom activity: students map a contentious claim (e.g., “This is harmful,” “This is unfair”) onto a few modes to see how context shifts what seems evident.

4. **Agrippa: the Five Modes and the structure of justification**

   * The **Five Modes of Agrippa** as a blueprint for the problem of justification: disagreement, regress, relativity, hypothesis, circularity. ([Wikipedia][44])
   * How Agrippa generates the classic “trilemma” for justification (infinite regress / dogmatic stopping point / circularity). ([Wikipedia][45])
   * Connecting to Unit 3: how definitional disputes can create “disagreement mode” traps.

5. **Modern skeptical problems (and why they matter outside philosophy)**

   * Cartesian-style doubt and skeptical scenarios (dreaming, deception). ([Wikipedia][46])
   * The problem of induction and scientific generalization (linking forward to Unit 9). ([Wikipedia][47])
   * Skepticism about testimony: when deference becomes gullibility vs. when doubt becomes conspiracism (linking back to Unit 6).

6. **Healthy skepticism vs. unhealthy skepticism**

   * **Healthy skepticism (fallibilism):** proportion belief to evidence; update; distinguish “not proven” from “false.”
   * **Unhealthy skepticism:** reflexive contrarianism; “nothing can be known”; cynicism masquerading as rigor; selective doubt used as a social weapon.
   * **Motivated skepticism:** applying hyper-critical standards to disliked claims and lax standards to favored claims (tie to Unit 5’s motivated reasoning). ([Wikipedia][41])
   * **Identity-protective / reactionary skepticism:** skepticism deployed to defend group identity (e.g., “distrust anything ‘their side’ says”), and to convert evidential questions into loyalty tests. ([Cultural Cognition][48])

**Core readings**

* Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, “Skepticism.” ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][40])
* Selections on Pyrrhonism and skeptical argument-forms (Aenesidemus and Agrippa). ([Wikipedia][42])

* The Five Modes of Agrippa and Agrippa’s Trilemma. ([Wikipedia][44]) ([Wikipedia][45])
* A short modern overview of skeptical scenarios (dreams, deception). ([Wikipedia][46])
* (Optional application track) Religious skepticism as a case study in evidential standards, testimony, and interpretive frameworks. ([Wikipedia][49])

## Unit 9 – Scientific Skepticism: Evidence, Demarcation, and Responsible Doubt in Public Life

**Guiding questions**

* What distinguishes *scientific skepticism* from (a) philosophical skepticism and (b) blanket distrust? ([Wikipedia][50])
* How do we decide what counts as good evidence, especially under uncertainty and social disagreement?
* What is the difference between being “open-minded” and being “so open-minded your brain falls out”?
* How do we teach skeptical thinking as a *skill + character trait*—not just a vibe?

**Sub-units**

1. **Scientific skepticism as a norm of inquiry (not a posture of rejection)**

   * Scientific skepticism as disciplined doubt: demanding adequate evidence, replicable support, and plausible mechanisms. ([Wikipedia][50])
   * The aim is not “debunking everything,” but *calibrated belief*.

2. **Demarcation: science, pseudoscience, and the gray zones**

   * The demarcation problem: why “looks scientific” isn’t enough.
   * Warning signs: ad hoc rescues, unfalsifiability, cherry-picking, moving goalposts, “Galileo” gambits.
   * Tie-in reading: *Philosophy of Pseudoscience* for the demarcation problem and case studies. ([Amazon][36])

3. **Standards of evidence and inference**

   * Correlation vs causation; confounds; base rates; “extraordinary claims” and proportional evidence.
   * Updating under uncertainty: what it means to be rational without demanding certainty (links to Unit 7 calibration).
   * Inference to best explanation vs. “just-so” narratives (links to Unit 2 narratives).

4. **Core tools for teaching skeptical thinking (classroom routines)**

   * “Claim triage” routine: **(a)** what exactly is claimed? **(b)** what would count as evidence? **(c)** what alternative explanations fit? **(d)** what would change your mind?
   * “Mechanism check”: does the causal story cohere with background knowledge, or does it require multiple miracles?
   * “Replication and robustness” habit: look for converging evidence across methods, not one dramatic study.
   * “Source and incentive audit” (Unit 5 + Unit 6): credibility, conflicts, institutional checks, and epistemic vigilance. ([dan.sperber.fr][30])

5. **Skepticism in the wild: misinformation, conspiracism, and pseudo-expertise**

   * Conspiracy thinking as an “overactive skepticism” that rejects mainstream epistemic institutions while accepting low-quality in-group testimony (links to Unit 6 echo chambers).
   * Pseudo-experts and the aesthetic of authority (links to Unit 5 epistemic vigilance). ([dan.sperber.fr][30])

6. **Motivated skepticism and identity-protective skepticism (when “skepticism” is selective)**

   * Motivated skepticism as selective scrutiny: opponents’ claims must be perfect; allies’ claims get a pass. ([Wikipedia][41])
   * Identity-protective skepticism: skepticism used to protect belonging, status, or ideology (e.g., “distrust is our identity”). ([Cultural Cognition][48])
   * Teaching intervention: “symmetry discipline”—students must apply the same evidential standards to claims they *like* and *dislike*.

7. **Scientific skepticism communities and public epistemology**

   * The skeptical movement as a social practice (norms, institutions, public education). ([Wikipedia][51])
   * How skeptical institutions can be epistemically helpful *and* how they can drift into performative contrarianism if virtues aren’t cultivated (ties back to Unit 1 virtue/vice).

**Core readings**

* Overview of scientific skepticism and its norms. ([Wikipedia][50])
* The skeptical movement and institutions (for public-facing skepticism). ([Wikipedia][51])
* Carl Sagan, *The Demon-Haunted World* (esp. “baloney detection” ethos). ([Wikipedia][52])
* Michael Shermer, *Why People Believe Weird Things* (optional, for psychology + public belief formation). ([Wikipedia][53])
* Massimo Pigliucci & Maarten Boudry (eds.), *Philosophy of Pseudoscience* (demarcation + cases). ([Amazon][36])
* “Motivated reasoning” as a bridge between Unit 5 and Unit 9 (optional short overview). ([Wikipedia][41])

## Possible capstone activities

* **Capstone project:**
  Students pick a live controversy (e.g., a pseudoscientific claim, a political frame, or an online conspiracy) and:

  * map the metaphors and frames in play,
  * analyze definitions and conceptual moves,
  * identify epistemic virtues/vices and epistemologies of ignorance involved,
  * discuss social-epistemic structures (testimony, echo chambers), and
  * propose metacognitive/educational interventions.
