title: "exposing abuse Jehovah’s Witnesses on trial part 1"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
In November 2012 Australian ex-Prime Minister Julia Gillard proposed a Royal Commission to investigate institutional responses to child sexual abuse. It covered a range of institutions including schools, churches and sports clubs in a total of 57 public hearings recording the testimonies of nearly 7,000 abused individuals around 64% of whom were male and 10% of whom said it was the first time they’d told anyone about their abuse. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
There would be testimonies from people like Hugh who was abused around age 10 by a scout leader who, after gaining his parents’ trust, had him over for parties where boys were plied with marijuana and alcohol and molested. And like Margaret, who was 11 when she was abused at a Salvation Army children’s home by a church captain who not only molested children but orchestrated their abuse of each other. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
To conduct the Commission’s investigation, a panel of six commissioners was appointed headed by Justice Peter McClellan a former Chief Judge for the Supreme Court of New South Wales and Assistant Commissioner for the Independent Commission Against Corruption. In May 2015, the Commission began to investigate ‘case 29’ of their public hearings which concerned responses to child sexual abuse within the Jehovah’s Witness organisation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Assisting counsel for the Commission was the formidable Angus Stewart QC. In a video called ‘concealing abuse’ I looked at how the Jehovah’s Witness organisation responded to real-life allegations of child sexual abuse against its members and how its policies tend to protect the abuser. For instance, even if they fully believe the allegations made against a member the congregation’s judicial and spiritual leaders —&nbsp;known as ‘elders’ — won’t take any action unless either there are at least two witnesses to the abuse 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
which is unlikely in view of the private nature of sexual abuse or the abuser confesses voluntarily — which is again, unlikely. Even when these exacting demands are met, justice is far from guaranteed. While the organisation possesses the judicial apparatus to eject molesters from congregations it repeatedly fails to use it. In a form of excommunication known as disfellowshipping individuals judged to be unrepentant sinners are completely shunned by all members including family. But individuals found guilty of molestation 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
can avoid this fate just by apologising. If they express repentance to their congregation’s elders, they can simply be ‘reproved’. All this entails is an announcement being made to their congregation that they’ve been reprimanded for an unspecified transgression. And that’s it. They’ll be left in the congregation, risking further molestation and the constant retraumatisation of the individuals they’ve abused who often feel forced out of their own congregation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
These kinds of misguided policies serve to protect abusers and punish the abused. Through its in-depth investigation of individual cases the Australian Royal Commission would expose a daunting maze of unthinkable additional hurdles faced by sexually abused children raised in the Jehovah’s Witness organisation. The Commission focused on the experiences of two individuals abused by members of the organisation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For anonymity, the individuals were codenamed BCB and BCG. BCB was the first to take the witness stand. She testified to the following account: She was born in 1967. When she was 10, her mother became a Jehovah’s Witness and started taking her and her brother to meetings. BCB drifted apart from her father who didn’t attend. At age 12, she met Bronwyn and Bill Neill and became friends with a daughter of theirs. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
She would attend meetings at their house and sleep over. Mr. Neill discouraged both girls from making non-Witness friends at school based on the idea that ‘bad association spoils useful habits’ a sentiment derived from the Biblical passage 1 Corinthians 15:33. The sexual jokes Mr. Neill started making in front of her would signal the onset of an escalating pattern of abuse. At age 14, when she stayed over with the Neill family he started inserting his tongue in her mouth when he kissed her goodnight. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
She would endure these inappropriate kisses for the next four years. She felt ashamed and scared, and worried about upsetting Mrs. Neill. But Mr. Neill was an elder, and she submitted to his authority. When she was 17, he intruded on her while she was showering somehow managing to unlock a locked door. He left when she screamed ‘Get out’ but later gave her a vicious belting for making too much noise in her bedroom. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
At age 18, she was subjected to more overtly sexual behaviour. He called her a nymphomaniac and a prostitute. One time, Mrs. Neill caught him tongue-kissing BCB and stopped him. But nothing further was said or done — and his forcefulness escalated culminating in an incident in which he trapped BCB in the bathroom and violated her manually and orally. The next day, he entered her room and suggested she’d enjoy full intercourse. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
She asked him to leave, then packed and returned to her parents’ farm. The next year, when he heard through his daughter that BCB had been seeing a couple of boys Neill invoked his role as an elder to summon her to talk about boys. She felt she had no choice. He took the opportunity to inspect her physically and abuse her verbally. Two years later in 1989, having married she confided in her husband and also a friend about Neill’s abuse. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The friend then disclosed this information to someone else. A week or so later, a young elder called Max Horley approached her to arrange a visit. During the visit, he revealed he’d come to talk about Neill. BCB gave some details but was too ashamed to recount the bathroom incident. Horley invited Neill to BCB’s house, to speak with her and her husband. Despite her discomfort at opening up her own home to her abuser she did as she was told on the assumption that Horley knew the correct procedure. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
She didn’t recall having the purpose of the meeting explained to her. And she felt too inhibited to recount the full details in front of Neill or challenge him when he suggested his behaviour was meant as a joke. Afterwards, BCB approached Horley and gave more details. This led to a second meeting, with the addition attendance of one Doug Jackson a circuit overseer — someone who supervises multiple congregations. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
His presence and the purpose of the meeting weren’t explained it was just presented as a ‘committee meeting’. Neill attempted to blame BCB for wearing revealing clothes but Jackson said the church didn’t accept that excuse. Again Neill’s presence inhibited her, as did being in a room full of men. She said if a female she trusted from the congregation had been there too it might’ve been easier. At the end of the meeting, Neill was told to apologise, which he did. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
BCB was given no explanation of the meeting’s outcome or of what would happen. Jackson gave her an article about child sexual abuse published in one of the organisation’s magazines, called the Watchtower. Not long after this, Mrs. Neill phoned BCB and told her ‘Bill didn’t abuse you.’ BCB reported this to Horley, who said he’d sort it out. Later that day, he phoned and said: ‘The Neills have asked that you not tell any more people about Bill out of respect for the family.’ Scared, disorientated and unsupported, she did as she was told. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It was only years later that she saw the perversity of being asked to respect the man who abused her when nobody had offered her the respect or support she deserved. Weeks later, it was announced that Neill had stepped down as an elder, with no reason given. Nobody talked to BCB about her abuse and she was still expected to attend study meetings at the Neills’ house. She asked not to go there — but was told she had to. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Mrs. Neill ignored her. Finally in 1994 she moved from the area to another congregation. In 2012, she gave a written statement to two elders including one Joe Bello, summarising her experience in an effort to support the case of anyone else Neill might’ve abused. Eighteen months later, Bello visited on an unrelated matter and BCB told him she was considering reporting her abuse to the Royal Commission. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
She said Bello later spoke to her husband and said: ‘You should ask [BCB] if she really wants to drag Jehovah’s name through the mud.’ BCB was dismayed to find that the burden of Neill’s shameful actions had been put on her shoulders. Although she eventually reported her experiences to the Royal Commission she suffered extreme misplaced guilt about betraying the organisation guilt that manifested in physical symptoms such as chest tightness, heart palpitations and difficulty breathing. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
She reported that her abuse destroyed her confidence and self-esteem and instilled in her a sense of victimhood and a constant paranoia that people were judging her. She went on to experience suicidal thoughts and a nervous breakdown. She said Neill’s position as an elder gave him power over her and suggested that if she’d been allowed to speak to other children outside the congregation they might’ve reported her abuse to the appropriate authorities. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
She suggested a number of changes in the way the organisation dealt with child sexual abuse. She said it should take allegations more seriously and report them to the police give proper support and protection for children and not require female targets of male abuse to speak in front of a room full of men, including their alleged abuser. She also noted that no compensation was offered. The Commission sought to address all of these issues. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Max Horley was the next to testify, and sworn in on a Biblical oath. Not long into Horley’s testimony assisting counsel Stewart noted that he seemed hesitant in his recollections and asked if this was because of the passage of time — which Horley affirmed. Judge McClellan asked Horley if he’d taken notes. He said he might’ve at the time — but they would’ve been destroyed. When asked why, he said the elders didn’t want their wives knowing what sort of things they were dealing with and that it was also to protect the person involved and the rest of the congregation 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
so they didn’t have to know about these things. It was not only a deeply patronising rationale but a dangerous one leaving congregations unsuspecting about the molesters in their midst which is exactly what molesters want. Horley confirmed that destroying notes remained the current practice. When asked if he was aware of his obligations to tell authorities about serious allegations of sexual assault Horley showed no awareness and said he’d contact his branch for advice on how to proceed. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Unthinking deference to the branch would become a familiar stock response from the elders called to testify to the Commission. Horley expressed confusion about what constituted criminal assault and later admitted giving no consideration to reporting it to the police. This was an individual invested with the safety and protection of an unquestioningly trusting congregation. A shepherd charged with guarding the flock. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But in the shepherd metaphor, Horley was more like the sheepdog cluelessly obeying the whistles of an unseen shepherd who could just as easily direct him to harm the sheep as to protect them. The Biblical passage Matthew 18:15 has been cited by the organisation as a basis for requiring abused individuals to confront their abusers with their allegations. McClellan asked Horley if he realised how inappropriate this process of confrontation was. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Horley said he could understand it now, but hadn’t reflected on it at the time because he was just following procedure. He agreed it could be very difficult for people who’d suffered abuse to share everything done to them in front of their abuser. He said the organisation wanted to keep Neill’s abuse as quiet as possible not to try to cover it up, but just to stop the conversation. But almost immediately, he contradicted himself saying they would’ve tried to keep the matter under wraps in another words cover it up. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Stewart made the case to Horley that by directing BCB not to speak to anyone in the congregation he left her with no one to talk to. Horley suggested that because BCB was still working in the community she could’ve spoken to people outside the organisation. But Stewart pointed out that members are advised not to have close friendships or associations with non-members. Horley affirmed that was true but said that whether members took that advice or not was entirely up to them. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Many of us who’ve experienced abusive environments with be familiar with this responsibility-dodging manoeuvre in which individuals are given clear instructions on what to do or what not to do then when they suffer as a direct consequence of following those instructions they’re told they didn’t have to follow them after all. And they’re blamed for their own suffering. The fact is Jehovah’s Witnesses are warned in the strongest terms against what are called ‘bad associations’ with non-members which they’re told will result in disaster. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For Horley to suggest that BCB was somehow supposed to view this merely as a piece of advice she was free to take or leave was disingenuous in the extreme. Stewart put it to Horley that he was saying two different things. On one hand, saying BCB couldn’t speak to people then on the other, that she could. Horley claimed he didn’t mean to cut BCB off from any support but admitted he couldn’t recall arranging anyone to assist her through the period. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Stewart produced a letter from Horley and the circuit overseer Doug Jackson to their branch office. The letter said: It appears that a number of brothers know about the matter and unfortunately there may be worldly people who also know. ‘Worldly’ is the derogatory term Jehovah’s Witnesses use for non-members. Stewart asked why it mattered if worldly people knew? Horley said the organisation didn’t want anything to detract from their ‘clean’ reputation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In fact the organisation is heavily invested in its reputation among outsiders. It seems perverse that it should be so concerned about what worldly people think considering it despises us as debauched and degenerate characterises us as the instigators of broken homes illegitimate births and sexually transmitted diseases and countless other emotional and physical woes and compares us to what it calls ‘death-dealing’ polluted air. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But of course projecting a ‘clean’ image is what the organisation relies on to attract new members. And it has no moral qualms whatsoever about using deception to try and maintain that patently false image. It even has a formal policy called ‘theocratic warfare’ that gives members explicit permission to deceive worldly people on the grounds that they’re not entitled to the truth. I explored the perversity of this policy in my ‘concealing abuse’ video. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
What that video doesn’t mention is a particular exception to the policy one of special relevance to the Royal Commission. Witnesses are told that when they take any oath to tell the truth or are placed on a witness stand, they’re obligated to speak the truth if they speak at all. In these circumstances, the only option they have other than to speak the truth, is to remain silent. It’ll become clear that even this rule was flouted by Jehovah’s Witnesses during the Commission hearing. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It’ll also become increasingly clear just how far down in their list of priorities came the welfare of the children they were supposed to protect. Horley and Jackson’s letter about Bill Neill to the branch office stated: ‘We recommended to him that he step down as an elder’ and that ‘He agreed to this.’ Stewart put it to Horley that it seemed they had offered Neill a chance to step down voluntarily, rather than be forcibly removed. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Horley denied this, claiming it was just an unfortunate choice of words. But those unfortunate words were consistent with BCB’s previous testimony that Neill had merely stepped down. In the same letter, Horley and Jackson added that they felt no further action or restrictions need apply. This meant Neill was free to participate in all the same church and Bible study meetings as before including meetings at his home which BCB was expected to attend. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The letter went on to make the bizarrely premature recommendation that once the matter had died down, Neill should be recommended as an elder again so he could help the congregation as he’d done in the past. Stewart asked Horley if by the phrase ‘dying down’ he meant once the controversy has abated. Horley claimed that the term ‘dying down’ was another case of unfortunate wording. When Stewart then suggested that Horley’s prime concern was about Neill’s reputation, he initially rejected the idea. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But Stewart continued along this line suggesting that Horley’s concern was about the functioning of his organisation and not about the protection of children in his congregation. Horley agreed. When Stewart put it to him his concern wasn’t about what support he could offer BCB. Horley admitted that while that had ‘some bearing’ for him it was more about Neill’s qualifications to teach. It was a stunning confession. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Towards the end of his period in the witness stand Horley was given a detailed account of BCB’s abuse. He hadn’t known about any of it and said it came as a shock to him. He was asked if he thought the fact it was only coming to light now had something to do with the process he engaged in when BCB made the initial complaint a process in which she had to make her allegations to her abuser and an elder who she knew was friends with her abuser. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
He said he could see the point being made. When it was suggested BCB needed a more nurturing supportive environment to make a full disclosure, he agreed. But when asked if he had any thoughts on what the organisation should do about it he reverted to compliant form, saying he had no comments he just followed the procedures. What came across from the many elders called to testify at the Commission was that they were so immersed in procedure they failed to consider the accuser’s experience. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Doug Jackson’s responses clearly illustrated this lack of empathy. When it was put to Jackson that BCB was unaware of the purpose of the meetings she was attending initially he flat-out rejected the idea. But Stewart took some time to remind him that as an elder he had knowledge not given to the congregation knowledge of judicial procedures, standards of evidence and punitive measures. Stewart then asked Jackson if he’d accept BCB wouldn’t know about these things. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Jackson changed his ‘no’ to a ‘maybe’. Stewart asked if Jackson could see how this lack of transparency would’ve left BCB in a position of vulnerability and confusion. Jackson said he did now. Stewart repeated to Jackson the portion of BCB’s statement in which she was asked in one of the judicial meetings whether she had anything more to tell and she falsely responded ‘No’ because of various inhibiting factors. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
These included talking in front of a room full of men talking in front of her abuser and being afraid of the consequences of telling the truth. Jackson accepted that talking about her abuse to a room full of men would’ve been very hard for BCB as would talking in front of her abuser. But when it was put to him that BCB didn’t feel it was a safe environment he said he didn’t know why she would’ve felt that because they tried to comfort her. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
He seemed unable to comprehend that his supposed efforts to comfort BCB weren’t enough to magically overcome all the intimidating factors she identified. Instead of admitting that he had failed to comfort her his instinct was instead to insinuate that the failure was hers she had failed to receive the comfort he offered. This kind of mindset is common in high-control groups that deny individuality. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Members are slotted into fixed procedures and expected to give fixed reactions. When they don’t, the fault is with them — not the procedure. McClellan put it to Jackson that the organisation’s investigative process inflicted further trauma on BCB. Jackson said he understood that now — but hadn’t appreciated it at the time. It’s instructive to reflect on the reflex dismissiveness of the elders who testified at the Commission whenever it was suggested that the abused individuals in their care felt unsafe or unsupported. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Judge McClellan and assisting counsel Stewart were two highly skilled communicators. They also wielded the power of the legal system. But even they had to repeatedly spend exhausting swathes of time walking the elders through their own procedures trying to get them to empathise with the experiences of those abused individuals. If, with their considerable skill and power they had to work this hard to break through the elders’ dismissiveness what chance did an unskilled powerless member of a Jehovah’s Witness congregation have of making themselves heard? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Another elder concerned with reputation was Joe Bello one of the elders BCB wrote to years after the abuse in an effort to protect other children from Bill Neill. Asked about whether he would ever report a matter to the police Bello fell back on the mantra-like evasion given by the other elders: he’d contact the branch. Bello confirmed BCB’s account that when her husband had mentioned they were thinking of talking to the Royal Commission Bello had asked what that could accomplish other than dragging Jehovah’s name through the mud. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It was put to him that this would be understood as a discouragement against going to the Commission. He said that wasn’t how it was meant — he was just thinking aloud. Although Bello initially seemed to regret his words and reflected that he shouldn’t have said them he then revealed that he stood by the underlying sentiment. Stewart asked him if, within his faith, Jehovah was considered a loving god. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
When Bello confirmed this, Stewart asked if Jehovah would not also then be more concerned about the victim than his own name. Defiantly, Bello replied: ‘Jehovah would be concerned about the victim but Jehovah is concerned about his own name too.’ Judge McClellan asked Bello if he’d been following the work of the Royal Commission. Bello hadn’t — despite knowing a couple of months previously that he would have to give evidence. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
He said he might’ve scanned the headlines of the Saturday paper but he didn’t watch the news or listen to the radio. His complete lack of interest in the Commission’s work was abundantly clear and consistent with the apathy exhibited by most of the witnesses testifying for the organisation. Doctor Monica Applewhite was paid by the organisation to be an expert witness in its defence. Applewhite presented herself as an independent consultant in child sexual abuse visiting institutes to make risk assessments 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
and develop educational programs and policies. This included assessing how they prevented abuse; how they responded to warning signs; how they responded to disclosures of abuse; and how they remedied the situation. Applewhite was an unexpected choice of champion for the Jehovah’s Witnesses because she was an active member of the Catholic church which the organisation has repeatedly dismissed as a false religion characterised as an enemy of true worship criticised for its political meddling and slated for its handling of child sexual abuse. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Leaving aside the strangeness of this alliance Applewhite’s testimony was a mess. Stewart and McClellan noted that many opinions offered in her report had no source references. Applewhite said she was already fully scheduled when she started working on the report so she hadn’t been conscientious about her citations. In fact what emerged from Applewhite’s report and testimony was that her so-called expert evidence consisted of browsing online material from the organisation’s own website and speaking to staff from its legal branch. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
She said she hadn’t reviewed any specific cases and couldn’t offer any opinion on whether the implementation of the organisation’s policies had resulted in law-abiding responses good practice of child protection or compassionate care. As Stewart noted, all she’d basically done was a documentary review. Applewhite showed a distinct lack of awareness of the power relationship between elders and congregation members erroneously stating that elders were merely viewed as ‘fellow workers’ by the congregation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
As Stewart pointed out, elders were very clearly characterised by the organisation as shepherds over the flock. Their privilege and authority was reinforced by the belief that elders were directly appointed by the Holy Spirit another fact of which she was unaware. Applewhite stated there was no requirement for elders or ministerial servants to be alone with children. But Stewart produced a branch document directed to all elders stating that elders and ministerial servants are put in a position of trust 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
that explicitly included being more liberal about leaving children in their care. Applewhite was also unaware of the fact that abused individuals were cautioned not to reveal facts about the congregation in group therapy. The only stipulation she’d heard in regards to therapy was that the organisation recommended choosing someone who respected their religious beliefs. As the facts about the actual experience of abused individuals emerged Applewhite began to withdraw some of her poorly considered support for the organisation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
She announced that if it turned out that people had to confront their abusers and had to sit in the room with no support that would not meet the standards of care. She conceded she hadn’t understood that that was the process. Applewhite stated that when somebody abuses and their internal mechanisms of control had allowed them to cross that line once she didn’t have confidence in those internal mechanisms of control for the future. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
As such, she suggested that the risk of re-offence was great and agreed that positive steps needed to be taken to ensure that such a person didn’t have access or the opportunity to abuse again. She said there should be strong and cooperative relationships with child protection authorities but had no awareness of the difficult relationship the Jehovah’s Witness organisation had with secular authorities. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The Commission didn’t consider that Applewhite’s report had assisted their enquiry and rejected her opinions on numerous grounds including lack of evidence or citations but most damningly, because she’d failed to investigate the experiences of a single survivor of child sexual abuse whose complaint was dealt with by the Jehovah’s Witness organisation. By the end of this first case the Royal Commission had already gathered confirmation of unthinkable negligence deeply inappropriate and traumatising procedures 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
and a cover-up mentality that elevated reputation far above the protection of children and led to the use of shaming tactics on abused individuals to try and silence them. From this atrocious start, things would only get worse. As I’ll be showing in part two shocking new levels of deception and corruption within the organisation would be laid bare including evidence that some elders had stooped to breaking their own rules in order to avoid exposing abuse. 
</p>
</div>
<br>
