title: "debunking prophets — part two"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is the second of a two-part series looking at prophets — the storytellers who claim special knowledge of hidden supernatural realms and unverifiable supernatural beings via revelations. Having no access to this supposed special knowledge ourselves the rest of us are expected to accept these prophets’ stories without question. In fact, we’re expected to believe their alleged revelations with as much conviction as if we’d experienced them firsthand. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Born in the 1700s, Thomas Paine, one of the founding fathers of the United States explains the problem with this arrangement. "Revelation, when applied to religion" "means something communicated immediately from God to man." ".... But admitting, for the sake of a case, that something has been revealed to a certain person" "and not revealed to any other person, it is revelation to that person only." "When he tells it to a second person, a second to a third, a third to a fourth, and so on" "it ceases to be a revelation to all those persons." 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
"It is revelation to the first person only, and hearsay to every other" "and consequently they are not obliged to believe it." "It is a contradiction in terms and ideas" "to call anything a revelation that comes to us at second-hand, either verbally or in writing." Focussing in on the Abrahamic religions, Paine continues: "When Moses told the children of Israel "that he received the two tables of the commandments from the hands of God" "they were not obliged to believe him" "because they had no other authority for it than his telling them so ...." 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
"When I am told that the Koran was written in Heaven, and brought to Mahomet by an angel" ".... I did not see the angel myself, and therefore I have a right not to believe it." "When also I am told that a woman, called the Virgin Mary" "said, or gave out, that she was with child without any cohabitation with a man" "and that her betrothed husband, Joseph, said that an angel told him so ...." ".... neither Joseph nor Mary wrote any such matter themselves" "it is only reported by others that they said so" 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
"it is hearsay upon hearsay, and I do not chose to rest my belief upon such evidence." Paine isn’t alone in rejecting hearsay. Barring exceptional circumstances, it’s disallowed as evidence in the courts. What Paine calls ‘hearsay upon hearsay’ is known as ‘double hearsay’. And it’s interesting to imagine what would happen if self-proclaimed prophets tried to make their cases in a courtroom. In this atmosphere of probing judicial rigour their cases would collapse instantly on two grounds. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The first is the aforementioned concept of hearsay. Any testimony about unsubstantiated messages from supernatural beings would be inadmissible. The second is jury tampering, formerly known as embracery. Self-proclaimed prophets depend on promises and threats to sway their audience. They dangle the carrot of astounding rewards and brandish the stick of unbearable torture. But bribery and intimidation are punishable offences in a courtroom setting. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Without these two tactics of hearsay and jury tampering by what other means can the self-proclaimed prophet win over a jury? Talking of juries, it’s worth reflecting on the qualities required of their members. For instance, jurors are adults, able to process the information before them critically. They need to be of sound mind, able to make sound judgements. And they need to be impartial, having no personal interest in the outcome. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The rigorous standards seen in courtrooms are specifically designed to minimise prejudicial elements such as fear, ignorance, bias and self-advancement that can pervert the course of justice. But prophets rely on all these prejudicial elements including the selection of children as their jurors bypassing impartial sound critical assessment generation after generation via childhood indoctrination. In criminal cases, a mistaken verdict is a serious business. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Whether an innocent person is found guilty or a guilty person is found not guilty the consequences for the parties involved can be life-changing. But when it comes to prophets the consequences of a mistaken verdict are immeasurably more far-reaching. When we succumb to their hearsay and their jury tampering and mistakenly accept them as genuine divine representatives we give them the power to rewrite the very definition of justice. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Just as light bends around a black hole, distorted by its tremendous gravity moral concepts of bad and good bend around the prophets, distorted by the infinite divine authority they claim for themselves. Child abuse, murder, genocide can all become good — if the prophets say so. Critical thinking, knowledge, love can all become bad — if the prophets say so. Reasoning ourselves out of this perverted morality can be extremely difficult partly because, generally speaking, we didn’t reason ourselves into it. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Can’t go back same way you came. But also because the perverted morality we’ve been taught becomes normalised. In a culture where all babies have their little fingers chopped off, in deference to their prophet eight fingers becomes the norm. The possession of ten fingers comes to seem disgusting, ungodly — a sign of animalistic depravity. When asked why the possession of ten fingers is wrong members of this culture might offer many spurious answers. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But, time after time as the flaws in these answers are exposed, they’ll give way to the same spurious answer: because the prophet said so. That’s where the thinking stops. When a culture accepts the moral authority of a prophet that prophet’s prejudices, hangups and delusions can be freely expressed in that culture without challenge. And&nbsp;until — by reason or by accident — some of its members manage to look past their prophet, that culture will remain chained to a fixed point in history becoming extremely — sometimes violently — resistant to progress. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We need to scrutinise the words of prophets very closely and ask ourselves: do they really reflect superhuman wisdom? In Alice Walker’s novel, The Color Purple 14-year-old Celie is married off by an abusive father to an abusive husband, called simply ‘Mr.__’ to look after his children and his house. She learns to be an obedient, submissive wife. A few years go by and Mister’s son Harpo falls in love with a woman called Sofia Sofia sees marriage as an equal partnership. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But following his father’s example Harpo thinks he should be in charge and tries unsuccessfully to verbally dominate Sofia. Mister tells Harpo that wives are like children. He encourages Harpo to give her a good sound beating to show her who’s boss. Celie is jealous and resentful of Sofia’s independent nature. She notices how Sofia just carries on talking when Harpo and Mister come in the room. She notices the look of pity on Sofia’s face every time Celie jumps when Mister calls. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And in a sad self-defeating moment when Harpo approaches Celie for advice on handling Sofia, she tells him, ‘Beat her.’ He takes her advice. But Sofia is strong and in the physical fight he provokes, he comes off much worse. To hide his shame, he claims he was attacked by a mule. Prior to this fight, Celie notes how happy Harpo and Sofia had been together — how after three years Harpo would still ‘whistle and sing’. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It was Mister’s ideas about wifely submission that caused all the unnecessary tension in Harpo and Sofia’s marriage. And yet, according to the self-styled prophet of Islam, Muhammad Mister’s ideas about men and women were pretty much on target. In passages Muhammad claimed were dictated to him by an angel on behalf of an all-knowing god women are again presented like children put under the charge of husbands who they’re expected to obey. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If they rebel, this supposed all-knowing god ordered an escalating sequence of punishments. First admonish her, as Harpo tried to. If that doesn’t work, withhold sex from her. If that doesn’t work, do what Mister and Celie advised: ‘Beat her’. In claiming to speak for all-knowing beings, prophets take on a superhuman burden. Every single pronouncement they make has to reflect the all-encompassing, timeless wisdom such beings would possess. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This burden of timelessness was underscored by Muhammad himself who proclaimed himself the last prophet —&nbsp;the seal of the prophets. His words have to stand for eternity. But do they? An all-knowing being would know that  — aside from being infantilising and brutalising — this sequence of punishments was simply an unworkable method of conflict resolution. It’s unworkable because it relies on suppression — keeping someone down in an inferior position. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That’s not a sustainable system. As the fictional example of Sofia and Harpo illustrates beating doesn’t work with people who have a healthy sense of self-worth. They don’t tolerate such demeaning, bullying behaviour and some of them will fight back hard. But even in Celie’s case, where we see a broken individual who submitted to beatings for years a vengeful anger grew inside her which eventually exploded. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Throughout history countless suppressed groups have risen up to demand fair treatment demonstrating what an all-knowing being would know: suppression doesn’t solve problems — it creates them. An all-knowing being would also know the destructive impact of trying to impose fixed relationship roles. Those of us with any broad experience of people will’ve met male-female couples who have no problem sharing power and treating each other respectfully as equals. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We’ll also have met male-female couples where the man is very happy for the woman to take charge maybe because in their particular case, out of the two of them she happens to be more confident, more organised, more proactive, more experienced. Their relationships work because both partners are a natural, complimentary fit. Muhammad’s fixed role system in which men are in charge of women and women devoutly obey would upset all these healthy, complimentary dynamics and corrupt these relationships. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
One of the fundamental principles of any wise advice, guideline or law is that it should not impinge on healthy systems. Some have defended Muhammad’s fixed role system on the grounds that if it was followed, it would create stability. But the stability defence is fallacious on two counts. It’s tautological because any system that everyone followed would create stability. If everyone followed a system in which women were in charge of men, there’d be stability. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And it’s also a red herring because social stability doesn’t mean the rules underpinning that stability are moral or healthy. Some of the most stable systems are the most ruthless and sadistic using fear and coercion to keep people in fixed roles that benefit some at the great expense of others. An all-knowing being would know all of this. But the being Muhammad claimed to commune with knew none of it. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
There is no timeless wisdom here. There is no far-reaching vision that encompasses, accommodates and nurtures all the healthy variation that exists within the human species. Instead we have a painfully parochial, short-sighted vision, grounded in antiquated sexual stereotypes that attempts to squeeze people into narrow, fixed roles, stifling their healthy, diverse natures. Coming from an all-knowing being, this relationship advice makes no sense whatsoever. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
What makes perfect sense is that this is the advice of a seventh-century merchant warlord whose ideas are deeply rooted in the less-enlightened social values of his own time. Apologists for Muhammad’s supposed revelations offer various red herrings to give a misleading impression of sexual equality. Some say Muhammad promoted equality of basic humanity by declaring that men and women originated from the same source. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But by that reasoning, slaves and their masters came from the same source. It doesn’t make them equal. Some say Muhammad promoted equality of social responsibility by declaring men and women protectors of one another. But the charge of protecting each other does not give them equal social standing. Some say Muhammad promoted the right to receive a fair share of wealth. But anyone familiar with Muhammad’s inheritance laws knows that female children inherit half as much as male children. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Calling these unequal sums a ‘fair share’ doesn’t magically make them fair. Some apologists have argued that merely giving a woman any set share of inheritance was a right unthinkable in many societies. This is a ‘be grateful for crumbs’ argument. Offering people a few more rights than they might get in some other societies is nothing to brag about. If every society condoned slavery for adults and children then one society declared children immune we could call it a step in the right direction, but not evidence of superhuman wisdom. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It’s true that some self-styled prophets might make what — at the time — appear to be some revolutionary advances including offering a few more rights to certain groups. But an all-knowing being would be able to communicate human rights in their complete final form especially if it was communicating them to its final prophet, as Muhammad claimed to be. And yet our understanding of rights has surpassed Muhammad’s unsurpassable revelations. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The 2:1 sexual ratio is seen in other areas. For instance, in surah 2, verse 282 of the Qur’an Muhammad claimed it was divinely revealed that in judicial circumstances two female witnesses were required to stand in for one male witness. This was so that if one of the women made a mistake, the other could help her. But why do women need this backup while men don’t? What abiding characteristic do women lack to warrant this strange remedial measure? If, for example, self-confidence was the issue, this surah should read: 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
.... And if there are not two self-confident people [available] then [bring] a self-confident person and two less self-confident people from those whom you accept as witnesses so that if one of the less self-confident people errs, then the other can remind .... Generalising a trait like poorer self-confidence to all women here simultaneously undermines self-confident women and fails to support unconfident men. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Again, an all-knowing being would know this was a distorted, inferior system. But Muhammad presented it as timeless, unsurpassable wisdom. Some Muslim apologists make my case for me when they respond with distaste to some of Muhammad’s declarations about men and women or flat-out deny he made them. In a video called ‘attacking beliefs’, I mentioned a passage from the Hadith —&nbsp;the multi-authored reports of the life of Muhammad written and collected years after his death — in which Muhammad is quoted saying: 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
"If a husband calls his wife to his bed and she refuses and causes him to sleep in anger" "the angels will curse her till morning." An ex-Muslim chum of mine said that years ago he’d questioned a Muslim leader on this specific passage. The leader suggested Muhammad wouldn’t’ve said such a thing and that the passage had to have some hidden context. He suggested it might refer to a wife who’d lost interest in her husband because she was having an affair. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Clearly, without any mitigating context the apparent promotion of sexual coercion depicted here makes for difficult reading. But making assumptions about what Muhammad did or didn’t say here is no casual affair. The consequences for a believer can be substantial. If this Hadith was intended for all wives but it’s mistakenly assumed there’s some hidden context that refers only to adulterous wives then faithful wives would think it’s ok for them to refuse their husbands and would unknowingly be cursed for doing so. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Conversely, if a hidden context does exist that refers specifically to adulterous wives but it’s mistakenly assumed that this Hadith applies to all wives then faithful wives would be vulnerable to sexual coercion when that was never intended. Either way, if a mistaken assumption is made the wife pays for it. So, what’s a wife to do? It is of course conceivable that some hidden context for this Hadith might be unearthed in the future. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But there’s no guarantee that this new context wouldn’t be even more reprehensible in nature. Surah 58 verse 22 of the Qur’an asserts that no believer can have affection for family members who oppose Islam. I’ve long been aware of this anti-family passage. But a few months ago, a hidden context was illuminated by a great YouTuber called The Masked Arab who gives in-depth Islamic scriptural context and references on a range of subjects. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
He cited the work of Ibn Kathir, described as a highly respected and influential Islamic scholar and an expert on tafsir — an Arabic word meaning ‘exegesis’ or ‘interpretation’. The Masked Arab noted that, in explaining the context of this Qur’an verse Kathir mentions an assortment of relatives, friends and special representatives of the central Islamic prophet Muhammad who each killed or intended to kill non-believing family members including fathers, sons, brothers or other relatives — and were praised for doing so. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Hidden contexts don’t always have a redeeming nature. They can sometimes reveal unexpected depths of depravity. Self-styled prophets take on a superhuman burden. The words of those who claim to speak for all-knowing beings must reflect that timeless wisdom. Unjust religious laws are often defended with the claim that humans just aren’t intelligent enough to see the perfect divine plan behind them. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But the ‘perfect divine plan’ argument could be used to justify any conceivable act — including the amputation of children’s fingers. We don’t need to possess divine intelligence to understand that laws that encourage bullying, suppression, inequity and sexual coercion don’t originate from a morally superior or praise-worthy source. Unable to substantiate their claims with hard evidence prophets repeatedly fall back on appeals to the unknown. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For instance, they might present their audience with an apparent mystery and offer some spurious interpretation for it that seems to support their bogus claims. One type of apparent mystery presented by prophets is known as a ‘miracle’ an event that seems to defy our understanding. In 1990, former sports presenter David Icke rebranded himself as a visionary after reportedly receiving spiritual messages from a psychic telling him he was meant ‘to heal the earth’. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
He declared that the world was an illusion — a ‘holographic reality’ — in which humans were being secretly exploited by a race of reptilian shape-shifters that feed off the emotion of fear. As a comparison, he’s cited the film The Matrix in which humans are immersed in virtual reality so that they can be secretly exploited by machines. In support of this claim he’s cited stunts like walking through fire, and walking on lava as examples of miracles. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
He’s suggested these miracles are able to be performed if you can disconnect your sense of reality from the consensus belief that fire burns and legs get burned. If you realise it’s all illusion —&nbsp;or to put it in Matrix language: "There is no spoon." Alongside David, let’s now put another individual associated with similarly impressive-sounding stunts: the Christian messiah, Jesus, whose reported ‘miracles’ include walking on water. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
So between David and Jesus we have two examples of purported miracles involving people walking on substances they shouldn’t be able to walk on. But while David’s lava-walking was presented in support of the claim that the universe is a holographic illusion Jesus’s hydro-ambulation was presented in support a very different claim. Here, there’s no suggestion that the world isn’t real. Here, it’s claimed that miracles are caused by a single powerful being who can bend the laws of physics — a god called Yahweh, of which Jesus was the earthly representative. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
These different suggestions about the cause of miracles conflict with each other. At least one of these individuals must be wrong. Possibly both. The good news we don’t have to waste our time puzzling over either of them. What we notice, when we pay attention to what’s going on here is that neither individual has provided any connection whatsoever between these supposed miracles and their supposed causes. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
When magicians reveal the secret processes behind their tricks, they provide the connection. When we see the scaffolding holding up the levitating man we gain insight. We understand. When we’re merely told the magician has special powers, we don’t understand. We haven’t been given an explanation. We’ve been given a story —  something with zero explanatory power. When lava-walking is presented as a miracle, it’s a story. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
When the principles behind lava-walking are conveyed in terms we can understand, it’s an explanation. And it might come as news to David Icke but the science behind lava-walking is well understood. Our ability to walk on lava or hot coals relies on that fact that these carbon-based surfaces are relatively poor conductors so their heat is transferred less effectively than high-conducting materials such as metals which can easily burn flesh at much lower temperatures. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But even with its low conductivity lava can only be endured for a matter of seconds before burns are sustained. One consequence of understanding the principles behind so-called miracles is that we can start making predictions. For instance, we can predict that we’ll never see David Icke agreeing to deliver his lengthy seminars while standing on lava. If he truly believed his physical body was an illusion, as he claimed —&nbsp;and as he invites us to believe — then he should have no problem holding his own feet to the fire. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But, because we now understand the principles behind lava-walking we can safely predict it’s not going to happen. The Bible isn’t full of explanations. It’s full of stories. For any one of the miracles it depicts we could concoct all kinds of stories. Take the miracle of Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead. We could claim that Lazarus represents the next stage in human evolution; that Lazarus is a monkey overlord exploiting us with holographic illusions; that Jesus possessed alien cloning technology; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
that Lazarus was an avatar. If Jesus had presented these stories, rather than his Yahweh story would we now be believing them instead? Far from standing out as people who should be listened to those who present miracles in support of their claims instantly mark themselves out as suspect. In attempting to use miracles as currency they show us they’re not in the business of providing explanations. They’re in the business of selling stories. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And when we buy their stories, we pay a greater price than we know. We need to take self-proclaimed prophets off their pedestals and bring them down to earth. When people encourage us not to think, we need to think twice about the company we’re keeping. We need to take note of any overbearing or threatening language being used to try and shut down our critical thinking and encourage our compliance. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We need to give a wide berth to those who punish requests for proof. False prophets often make demonstrable blunders based on their own limited knowledge failing to imagine that our expanding knowledge might expose them in the future. Joseph Smith failed to foresee that our discoveries about Egyptian hieroglyphics would expose his false translation of Egyptian funerary texts as the Book of Abraham. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
While supposedly channelling all-knowing beings from distant planets UFO prophet Dorothy Martin made several blunders including a claim that the scientific term ‘sound barrier’ referred to a barrier around the earth that had been punctured by bombs and let extraterrestrial communication through — when in fact the term simply refers to the sudden increase in drag an object experiences as it approaches the speed of sound. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Founder of Scientology Lafayette Ronald Hubbard claimed aliens had been transported to earth by space planes that looked exactly like earth’s DC8 aeroplanes. But an aeroplane’s wings are aerodynamically designed specifically to exploit the properties of air to create lift. They would be redundant in space. Anyone can invent a set of laws to live by but what’s striking in the case of self-styled prophets is that they’re devoid of the enduring social insights we would expect from the superhuman authorities they claim to represent. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Those who use miracles to support their claims disqualify themselves from consideration. Any number of outlandish claims could be made about the same miracle. If no explanatory connection is made between miracle and cause, it’s just story-telling. We need to take great care about who we put on pedestals. That’s especially true when we’re talking about people who claim some superhuman authority. Because if we succumb to their authority, we give them licence to redefine our entire reality. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Our susceptibility to prophets begins with ourselves —&nbsp;how hungry we are for truth rather than comfort; how determined we are to demand good evidence rather than accept dogmatic assertions; how ready we are to draw attention to the problems we find rather than allow them to drift into soft focus and forget about them. We should also keep in mind that the manipulative tactics used by prophets aren't the exclusive domain of religion. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We find similar tactics in other areas including politics, economics and education. Wherever we find them, they should raise red flags and spark our scrutiny. Billions of us are living with bogus stories about the world. We get swept up in those stories and fail to investigate their origins. We think our faith is in the story, but our faith is in the storyteller. And storytellers abound. These are the human beings who design the world’s religions; who generate all the unsubstantiated, contradictory detail we hear about gods 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
— the detailed rituals, the detailed mythical histories, the detailed lists of bizarre, unjust laws. The time is long overdue for debunking prophets. 
</p>
</div>
<br>
