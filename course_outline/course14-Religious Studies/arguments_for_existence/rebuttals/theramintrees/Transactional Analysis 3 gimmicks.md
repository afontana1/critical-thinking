In the previous section I looked at how TTE modeling for drama and mental games For example, Steven Karpman's Drama Triangle Where the players exchange their dramatic roles Between the victim and the executioner (persecuted) and the savior And the equation of games for Eric Burns Where the two parties can be seen as They exploit each other to meet a need Sometimes the T -TB suggests What to do about mind games It is discovering the need of the other person And not to provide them. The truth is that we cannot determine 
</p>

<br>

<div>
<p>
Always the needs of others If some of them are more insulting to you, How can you determine if they are They already believe in the validity of these insults? Or if they know that it is not real And they are only trying to provoke you? Indeed, people, at times, They cannot determine their own needs Because they behave from needs Located outside their awareness I think we might go a lot of time In an attempt to discover [needs] people While there is a more effective strategy It is summarized in trying to understand ourselves 
</p>

<p>
If we can know the thing in ourselves, Which drives us to enter the games ... We will never need to know the motives hidden from the other person The needs of the targeted person are called According to the TA, "tricks or baits" The word "trick or taste" may look like It is a "valuable rule" However, despite the possibility of some tricks From deteriorating behavior or delusions... We haven't found it well yet, Tricks can be based on rules Very positive and produced by some groups For example rules such as 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
"Put your confidence in people" do good deeds Within an audience of positive interactors But not among masses of parasites. Here is this living example of the "tricks" In a game he called Erik Bern "Schillil," (A) A guest at a party (B) (A) is a drink on a dress (B) that is angry But she holds her nerves, and (A) apologizes (B) is pronounced in a phrase that indicates forgiveness (A) continues to spill the drink, And rhythm and breaking things Then he apologizes for everything he does, (B) appears its page .. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
About all of this on social apparent But what you feel (B) is a fact that is far from forgiveness They know that these accidents are completely intended, And (a) also knows that she knows that So, if both know That what is happening is intentional Why did (B) continue to keep up with this demonstration? Because the motivation is the "bait-trick" (B) It is her need to be "Aqlana" Which can appear in many forms. The general principle may be: "I have to be rational" Or it can be less direct "I have to show rationally." The rule (principle) may be conditional 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
As "I have to show rationally If the other seems to be rational" One of the most powerful variations is the next "I will show that I am rational to show you that I am better than you." Do not suffice (b) in this case By maintaining its balance, It proceeds to prove an order on (a) The more damage it causes B got more opportunities to show her superiority. If we look again at... Burns game "Why don't you, yes but" We talked about in the previous video Where (A) poses a problem (B) introduces a series of solutions 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But (A) points out a defect In each of the ideas (b) We can see similar variations as possible Here it seems that (B) a need to be a help, The general principle may be: "I have to be helpless" Or "I have to appear as a certain" Or other similar variations. But what might actually attract B? "I can make you feel grateful because I help you." This is a possibility of a very strong taste Because it is completely harmony with the other person Who can in turn respond Under the beneficial psychological situation "Continue what you are doing." 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Sometimes it is possible to take us completely Where we do not feel that we are the one who begins the game We may think that we are the one who responds to the games In fact, we are the one who incites it (B) note that (a) looks Slightly compressed, and A replies that she feels it With a decrease in its morale due to something, But it is fine, so (b) is done Due to his unbridled desire to help By submitting a series of suggestions that She can raise her morale (A) rejects it all. After a while, B says to himself: 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
(A) You play with me, "Why don't you, yes, but" What you want is to get attention only For my negligence, here I am trying to help her! But A wasn't playing that game Rather, she takes responsibility Her feelings And you do not need anything from (b) Who did the game For his need to have a feeling of gratitude The game is used to obtain feelings of feelings Associated with the situation of unappreciated sacrifice If we find ourselves practicing Specific game or games We can start getting to know our needs By resorting to some sincere self -survey. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
What are we really seeking through the game? What is the perfect imaginative output? Are we looking to gain something? Do we want to avoid something? I seek to consolidate a status or impression What do we want to happen For the other player at the end of the matter Answers to these questions will give us Important signs that lead us to "our tricks/ our bait" Some "tricks/ bait" possess less clear ties With the games you bring The "Why don't you do, yes but" game It revolves around "Help" But it can succeed with someone He has no interest in helping at all 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, a person may be used Doesn't feel relaxed in social situations A stream of suggestions to ease Of the awkward moments of silence When we become aware of the exact nature For this trick in a specific game We will have a greater chance In the disintegration of that game As soon as we have a knowledge of "our tricks" We can rely on our thinking to go out This is accountable for wrong assumptions It contains.Or we can act so that we can come out Act in contrast to the need and control it Instead of letting others control it 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Tricks can come in the form Rules or expressions of request Like those previously mentioned The global style of these rules It is evidence of the problems that tend to create "To be ..." Is it always obligatory To be that exact thing? If our goal is to be Example viewing here Not only we will cause disappointment for ourselves Mostly people will appear ... They exploit these expectations Unrealistic And they use it against us in the games they play If we discover that such "messages" You control our leadership 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We can estimate its realism. Depending on the adjective We are examining We may decide to change it in this way Or this way. Sometimes we carry ideas Like "I must be logical" without being aware Our definition that we use for this word It is the definition of a deviation If we dig deeper Inside what we mean when using The word "logical" we may find "messages" as follows: "I have to not show anger" "I have to avoid uncomfortable situations." "I have to keep my personal photo. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
As a nice person " But what does it mean really To be "logical" Our research in the definition of the word We find things like this -Displaying the logic -Watering to give the correct judgments Is it the right judgment to leave a person? It deliberately continues with the carcinogenic Picking things and breaking them While we pretend to be indifferent and do not say "no" If you know that someone is standing Those things are intended It "makes sense" to explain to them You know exactly what they are doing and you should fire them. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Even if you are not sure they do that Intentionally or not You may be ready for noble About a single isolated incident But with the continued damage It is "logical" to ask them The cost of damage If they refuse to pay It "makes sense" to ask them to leave. If one of them is already reckoning That is their own responsibility as a mature And they can deal with it. in many ways They can work on it to become less violated Or take preventive measures To avoid situations that may lead to accidents Or can they bear the consequences of their breach 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They compensate for the damage they cause Either they expect others to bear them And bear all the trouble and the costs that have It is "logical" Therefore, sometimes it becomes necessary to get rid of... Wright forms of words like this And replace it with actual definitions It can prevent games from taking place. "Moin" is another word that can... It is overflowing with the dismissed definitive definitions For years, A complained about B. He was not a good friend of her She complains when he invites her to attend places And activities you do not like 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
He must know that she does not like her, And then she complains He does not invite her to the above She now feels neglected. She complains when B asks her About things in her life she does not want to talk about her Then she later decided she wanted to talk She complains when B does not ask her about it And throughout the time you remind him A "real" friend doesn't do that (B) He is fighting a losing battle here In the company of (a) He is no longer the real spontaneous person Which everyone else knows 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
He is now impersonating a role Instead of being a person He hopes to be a "good friend" It is something that he will never be Because the definition of a "good friend" here He is "able to read thoughts" B can exit the game By recovering the possession of the rules And he rejected mysterious fluctuations For the expectations imposed by (a) About what determines being a good friend And to define himself What is acceptable behavior from a friend? If we know our actions that "our tricks" We can not act in that way If your need is harmony 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Lead you to maintain peace in your family Try not to do that Let others resolve their differences After all, if they don't have a skill Dealing with some of them What will they do if you are not present? If your need for approval means... Don't say "no" when people ask you for a favor Say "no" to whoever asks you for the next favor Just watch what is happening Watch to feel when you enter This new area And notice everything that calls you back into the game Feelings of guilt or angry thoughts And the attempts at rationalization that appear in your head 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
To make the game justifiable "This time only" "Increased provocation from players" For the purpose of your jar to participate and meet their needs Notice all of this, and hold on to your rejection To engage in the game Experience that “dissonance” and that “disapproval” I realize, though some of that It may cause discomfort, Those feelings are not in fact "unbearable" There may even be a feeling of “liberation.” From years of slavery to that need We don't have to reveal what the games are To get ourselves out 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
From mental games that drain time With a little self-examination We can understand our own needs And with some logical trial We can question the assumptions of those needs And with a little love of discovery We can test the feeling of trying something different Translated by Hammam Abdul Wadud Youssef
