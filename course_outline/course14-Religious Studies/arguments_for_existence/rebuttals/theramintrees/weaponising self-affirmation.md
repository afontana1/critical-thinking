title: "weaponising self-affirmation"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
Recovery from abuse — whether it’s political,&nbsp; religious, occupational, domestic — involves the same fundamental process. Targets have to restore what the abuse eroded sometimes almost into non-existence: their sense of self. That involves reasserting the freedoms&nbsp; and entitlements they’ve gone without looking after their own welfare refusing to accept unfair responsibility getting comfortable expressing&nbsp; needs they’ve previously suppressed and ending destructive relationships. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Targets have to replace old self-negating&nbsp; thoughts of inferiority and unworthiness with new self-affirming principles. As we know, terms from psychology like ‘paranoid’, ‘unconscious’,&nbsp; ‘passive aggressive’ that find their way into common usage aren’t always applied accurately. Or therapeutically. Often they’re used to attack&nbsp; and falsely pathologise people. In a similar way as therapeutic self-affirming principles have become more widely known, they’ve been seized on by abusers 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
and twisted into weaponised parodies. Sentiments intended to repair&nbsp; damage are used to inflict damage. Concepts intended to promote&nbsp; equal freedoms and entitlements are used to assert unequal liberties and licence. When malignant abusers speak of valuing themselves of exercising autonomy, of resisting suppression it all sounds very reasonable until we realise that for them valuing&nbsp; themselves means devaluing others exercising autonomy means&nbsp; restricting the autonomy of others 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
suppression means not being&nbsp; given special priority. These pseudo-self-affirmations illustrate why even when targets and malignant&nbsp; abusers speak the same words they’re often using very different languages. Targets who work to establish a level&nbsp; playing field show a lateral orientation where people can coexist side by side. This is literally at cross purposes with abusers who show a vertical orientation constantly working to elevate&nbsp; themselves above others sometimes because of a personal superiority complex 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
sometimes because some&nbsp; religious or political ideology encourages them to look down on other people sometimes a combination of the above. As targets strive for equity&nbsp; abusers strive for inequity. As targets work to restore balance&nbsp; abusers work to restore imbalance. For targets, the vertical orientation&nbsp; of the abuser is oppressive. Their needs, freedoms,&nbsp; individuality, sense of self are all squashed down to accommodate the abuser. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In a perverse mirror image of this abusers claim the lateral orientation&nbsp; of targets is oppressive to them. From their elevated position, equality&nbsp; and fairness seem diminishing. While the target’s claim of&nbsp; oppression is consistent with reality the abuser’s is not. The abuser’s claim of oppression doesn’t represent some alternative&nbsp; but equally valid ‘truth’. It’s the bogus product of a misconception one that inspires equally bogus&nbsp; attempts at self-affirmation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Some of these pseudo-self-affirmations&nbsp; are easily dismissed. But others are more slippery sometimes exploiting poorly&nbsp; conceived mental health concepts. For some targets, trying to get a grip&nbsp; on them is like trying to hold wet soap. I want to look at some examples that&nbsp; crop up repeatedly in correspondence. It was around 15 years ago&nbsp; that I was sat in my front room listening to a house guest I’ll call Vigo ranting about how his father&nbsp; owed him unconditional love. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Apparently his father had&nbsp; refused contact for several days in response to constant abuse from Vigo who believed he should be free&nbsp; to behave any way he wanted towards his father and that his father was obliged to respond with an uninterrupted stream of love. Vigo showed no remorse and minimised his abuse with various titbits of&nbsp; Christmas-cracker philosophy. He pontificated that real love&nbsp; was ‘messy’ and ‘painful’. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Odd how it always seemed to be his&nbsp; father who got the pain and mess. Vigo’s shrill sermon on unconditional love was one of my first glimpses&nbsp; of a rampant narcissism that for a time flew under my radar. Unconditional love is a&nbsp; term I could happily consign to the trash can of history. It’s presented as the answer to conditional love — love that’s only given if targets&nbsp; comply with various selfish demands. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If they don’t —&nbsp;if they don’t&nbsp; choose a particular career if they don’t choose the right partner if they don’t follow certain&nbsp; religious or political beliefs love is withdrawn. People subjected to this iffy brand of love often fail to develop a stable&nbsp; internal sense of worth. They come to depend on unstable external supply only feeling fleeting experiences of worth when they fulfil the demands of other people. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Self-affirming therapy and literature&nbsp; promote ‘unconditional love’ as the healthy alternative to this coercion. Targets are told they should&nbsp; be loved for who they are without having conditions imposed on them. Unfortunately abusive individuals like Vigo have also latched on to this&nbsp; poorly articulated concept insisting they should be loved for who they are without having conditions imposed on them. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Conditions like taking&nbsp; responsibility for their actions showing remorse, offering restitution and rectifying their behaviour. We’re back to the fundamental&nbsp; conflict in orientation. We have targets pursuing equal status seeking only to eliminate oppressive&nbsp; conditions that violate their freedoms. And we have abusers pursuing superior status seeking to eliminate all conditions placed on them but happy to impose conditions on others. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Some of the most extreme examples&nbsp; are found in religious scripture. The god character of the Bible was depicted perpetrating all kinds of atrocities from the explicit endorsement of sexual slavery to the joyful celebration of mass infanticide to the implementation of death sentences for a raft of victimless activities including working on the Sabbath and approaching a tabernacle. Despite its profound disregard for life this morally chaotic god character&nbsp; demanded unquestioning love. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The love it offered in return&nbsp; was strictly conditional only bestowed if its commands were obeyed although even then, love&nbsp; was by no means guaranteed. It’s worth mentioning a similar&nbsp; weaponised self-affirmation we might call ‘unconditional attraction’ where individuals insist other&nbsp; people should find them attractive. People who don’t are accused of&nbsp; prejudice and\or pathologised. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Meanwhile these self-aggrandising individuals have no problem labelling&nbsp; other people unattractive. The concept of love without any conditions is an unworkable foundation for relationships even as a two-way model. Placing no conditions on each other means whatever we do — however good or bad — is of no consequence. No part of us is rejected but no part of us is valued either. Lecturer in political philosophy Derek Edyvane underscores the problem: ‘.... a large part of what we value ‘about being the object of another’s love 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
‘is that we take it to imply&nbsp; an informed and positive ‘(or at least not negative) ‘objective evaluation of our character. ‘We think of love as being more ‘than the arbitrary expression&nbsp; of a subjective whim. ‘We want to know that there exist reasons ‘that can render this person’s love&nbsp; for us intelligible to others.’ What meaning could someone’s love&nbsp; have for us if we could be anybody? Healthy love isn’t love without conditions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It’s love with boundaries. Boundaries give a clear structure that preserves the freedoms and entitlements of both parties. A common characteristic of&nbsp; unhealthy and abusive relationships is that identities become blurred and merged. Individuals become lost in each other no longer able to separate their own preferences, beliefs, desires, needs. Firm boundaries prevent this kind of enmeshment allowing people to maintain&nbsp; a separate sense of self. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
None of us is owed love. We either inspire it in some people or we don’t. Those who don’t inspire it often try to compel it. But the use of compulsion in itself turns any potential love into a degraded pretence. Targets of abuse are routinely&nbsp; blamed for their abusers’ feelings — their jealousy, anger, resentment, sorrow — and taught that it’s their responsibility&nbsp; to keep their abusers happy. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Over time, targets often become acutely sensitised to other people’s emotional states and instinctively take on the&nbsp; burden of looking after them. Self-affirming therapy and&nbsp; literature encourages targets to question this misguided sense of liability and to realise they don’t control the emotional states of other people and it’s not their job to fix them. They’re not responsible for&nbsp; other people’s feelings. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This self-affirmation has been seized on and repurposed by abusive individuals who use it to try and avoid&nbsp; accountability for their actions. When targets have an emotional&nbsp; reaction to their mistreatment their abuser tells them: ‘I’m not&nbsp; responsible for your feelings.’ And they’re absolutely right. Just as we can’t control their emotional states they can’t control ours. For some targets this feels like a stumper. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They struggle to refute their&nbsp; abusers’ slippery insinuation that if they’re not responsible&nbsp; for the target’s feelings they can’t be accused of abuse. The focus on feelings here&nbsp; is a complete red herring. People have all kinds of reactions to abuse. Some people shut down&nbsp; completely and show no emotion. In assessing whether a situation is abusive we don’t base our judgement on&nbsp; people’s emotional reactions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We ask if there are persistent patterns of controlling and coercive behaviour that violate their freedoms and entitlements. Are there attempts to isolate them? Are their private communications monitored? Is their physical appearance dictated? Are their job opportunities sabotaged? Are their finances restricted? Are their resources exploited? Are shaming tactics used? Are there threats of violence? These are the factors that define abuse and incriminate individuals in law. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
As noted by the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service — an official legal body that determines&nbsp; which cases make it to court — ‘Domestic abuse does not always&nbsp; have to be physical to be prosecuted ‘— sometimes victims may not&nbsp; even be aware it is happening.’ Agreeing with our abusers&nbsp; that they’re not responsible for our feelings doesn’t in any way deny their accountability for what they do. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In fact, realising our abusers&nbsp; don’t and can’t control our feelings is often a key moment in recovery. Targets of abuse often lose their spontaneity. They fall into fixed habitual responses. Abusers learn these predictable responses. And when they provoke one of those responses the target feels controlled. But that sense of being controlled begins to fade when targets change their responses. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For some years in my childhood an abusive relative always seemed able to control me with the same threat: ‘If you don’t do X, you and I are gonna fall out.’ Hearing that line, like clockwork,&nbsp; I’d fall into silent compliance. Then one day, I found myself replying ‘Yeah. We will fall out.’ The look of bewilderment was priceless. Those five words transformed our relationship. We both knew the threat had lost its power and it was never used again. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But more importantly, I&nbsp; began to recognise the part my own fixed responses played&nbsp; in my sense of being controlled. Targets of abuse often become so hyper-focused on attending to their abusers’ demands they habitually neglect their own needs. Self-affirming therapy and literature encourage targets to exercise self-care. Predictably the concept of self-care has been weaponised by abusive individuals who use it to justify selfish indulgence. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
During my training as a therapist a fellow student I’ll call&nbsp; Zane repeatedly tried to impose his values, his ideas, his&nbsp; preferences on the rest of the group. To justify his demands he’d regurgitate the same phrase ad nauseam: ‘I’m just looking after my needs!’ If his demands weren’t met, he’d&nbsp; often refuse to participate. An example. During the course Zane complained repeatedly about students using adult&nbsp; language in his presence. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
He said it was course and offensive. One day, in a group discussion he declared we all had an obligation to use what he called ‘genteel language’ — ie refined and respectable. It was pointed out to him that no one had consented&nbsp; to any language restrictions and it wasn’t his place to tell&nbsp; people how to express themselves. I was curious what he’d do&nbsp; when he started seeing clients. Unlike Zane, I’d already found a work placement in a therapy centre and I&nbsp; recounted some of the language 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
used by my own clients in recent sessions. Hearing the words he flinched in disgust. I asked him how he thought clients&nbsp; would respond to his disapproval. Did he think they’d keep coming? After a long pause, he changed the subject. Despite the intensely&nbsp; introspective nature of the course Zane showed little self-reflection and remained a disruptive presence to the end interrupting and sabotaging exercises to assert his petty personal preferences in the name of self-care. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For individuals like Zane exercising self-care translates&nbsp; to demanding care from others expecting everyone else to forego their freedoms and entitlements for the comfort of one individual. Instead of attempting personal growth they expect the world to shrink. Targets of abuse and&nbsp; manipulation are often trained to stay perpetually on the defensive; to always be ready to give&nbsp; convincing justifications for any action or lack of action any word spoken or unspoken any belief or thought expressed or unexpressed. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
As part of recovery, targets are&nbsp; encouraged to reject this interrogation; to acknowledge that where&nbsp; their actions and beliefs don’t impose on anyone else’s basic freedoms they have nothing to justify. They don’t have to explain themselves. Predictably, this self-affirmation&nbsp; is abused by some individuals to try and deny accountability. For many abusers no matter how vicious or&nbsp; destructive their behaviour might be the idea of being answerable to people they regard as inferior and subordinate is insulting. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Again, the way this statement is used by targets and abusers illustrates&nbsp; their different orientations. Targets use it to assert their equal freedoms. Abusers use it to gain special licence. And again, some of the most extreme examples are found in religious scripture. As mentioned earlier, the god character depicted in the stories of the Bible was a fickle figure. Even its most obedient&nbsp; followers were savagely abused like the blameless god-fearing Job whose children were murdered and who was stripped 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
of his health and property&nbsp; as a test of his devotion. When the devastated Job had the audacity to complain about the callous&nbsp; destruction of his life he was subjected to one of the most&nbsp; drawn-out narcissistic rants in the Bible — chapters full of the god character&nbsp; boasting about its amazing divine powers including a bizarre section listing the many ways it could dominate a sea monster called leviathan. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The message is clear. The god character doesn’t have to explain itself not because it has nothing to answer for but because it’s more powerful than Job. This is the definition of totalitarianism. To defend this tyranny analogies are often made with parents who sometimes behave in ways that might superficially&nbsp; appear mean to their children but that’s only because they’re&nbsp; too young to understand. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The obvious problem with this defence is that abusive parents — who are deliberately mean to their children — can use exactly the same line: ‘You’re just too young to understand’. So how do children distinguish between apparently mean and actually&nbsp; mean and protect themselves? According to the ‘just too&nbsp; young’ argument, they don’t. They just have to take it&nbsp; — until they’re old enough to figure out they were abused. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The ‘just too young’ argument&nbsp; is massively overstated. The fact that children are asking a question is a sign they’re ready for some kind of answer even a partial one. We don’t need to overwhelm them with information. We can hand it to them a piece at a time, pausing to see if they’re&nbsp; satisfied — or ready for more. To give them nothing — to angrily dismiss their attempts&nbsp; to understand as Job was dismissed — is to leave them to fill in the blanks with very predictable&nbsp; child-like fears and misgivings. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Would any loving parent want that? Would any loving god want that? One of the most basic methods we use to help distinguish apparent&nbsp; meanness from actual meanness is to give individuals the&nbsp; opportunity to explain themselves. Whether it’s in domestic&nbsp; life, at work, in criminal law we understand there are&nbsp; sometimes surprising contexts behind destructive behaviour. We often extend each other&nbsp; a presumption of innocence. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But that presumption has limits. If someone refuses to offer a&nbsp; mitigating account for a destructive act we don’t just presume an innocent&nbsp; motive and drop the issue If we did, anyone charged with a crime could simply refuse to explain&nbsp; themselves and they’d be free to walk. Destructive acts have to be accounted for whether they’re human or divine. In the absence of any explanation the act is all we have to go on. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And it’s on that basis that&nbsp; we have to form our judgement. Humans or gods who refuse to explain themselves are entirely responsible for the judgements&nbsp; made about their destructive acts. Abusive relationships are&nbsp; often full of projection. Targets are routinely accused of harbouring beliefs, desires, schemes and&nbsp; motives they don’t possess. Their abusers are just projecting&nbsp; their own fantasies onto them reflecting the abusers’ own&nbsp; hang-ups, ignorance and vanities. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
On the flip side, when&nbsp; targets confront their abusers with accurate negative perceptions they’re accused of projecting their own issues. Self-affirmation work&nbsp; involves separating ourselves from other people’s fantasies. Sometimes easier said than done. Abusers often deliver their projections with such forceful unshakeable conviction some targets privately wonder if&nbsp; maybe there’s some truth in them. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
There’s nothing wrong in wondering that. Quite the opposite. It shows you’re open to hearing critical feedback. Without that openness, we can&nbsp; never get to know ourselves. And getting to know ourselves is crucial if we’re ever to separate&nbsp; the truth about ourselves from the fantasies about us. In my first introductory course to therapy a great instructor called Jenna articulated her approach to&nbsp; receiving critical feedback. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
She said, ‘If you tell me&nbsp; something critical about myself ‘that I don’t recognise, I’ll&nbsp; hold it with me for a time. ‘Reflect on it. See if I&nbsp; can see what you’re seeing. ‘If I find there’s some truth in what you say, ‘I’ll gratefully take it on board. ‘You’ve taught me something about myself. ‘But if I find there isn’t any&nbsp; truth, then I’m looking at you. ‘And I’m wondering what issues you have ‘that you’re trying to offload on me.’ Of course we don’t need to reflect long and hard 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
on every bit of critical feedback we get. When people claim the reason for my atheism is that I’m angry with their gods I know instantly they’re wrong. I feel no more anger towards their gods than I do towards vampires, gorgons, wendigoes or any other unsubstantiated mythical character. People make this false charge&nbsp; of anger for various reasons. Some just can’t conceive of individuals&nbsp; not believing in their gods. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Some are just brainlessly parroting the charge they’ve seen other people making. And of course some are&nbsp; playing very deliberate games trying to irritate and provoke. But whatever their reason, in every case I immediately know they’re talking rubbish. Because I know that part of myself. The Johari window is a tool used to reflect on the parts of us that&nbsp; are either known or unknown to ourselves and others. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Named after its creators,&nbsp; Joe Luft and Harry Ingham it divides the individual into four basic areas. The ‘open’ or public self is the part of us that’s accessible to everyone&nbsp; —&nbsp;ourselves and others. Its opposite, the ‘unknown’&nbsp; self, is the part no one knows. It contains elements that may&nbsp; or may not emerge at some stage but for the time being fail&nbsp; to register with anyone — including ourselves. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The ‘unaware’ self is the part of us that others can see — but we can’t. This part contains a mix of elements including aspects of ourselves we&nbsp; just haven’t bothered to look at but also aspects we actively distort or deny because they don’t fit with our self-image. Finally, the ‘private’ or hidden&nbsp; self is the part known only to us. This part’s also been called the ‘façade’. But that carries associations of deception and privacy doesn’t entail deception. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Self-awareness work reduces&nbsp; the unaware and unknown parts bringing them into consciousness. Cultivating self-awareness isn’t easy. It demands rigorous honesty,&nbsp; openness and integrity. We might not appreciate some of&nbsp; the parts of ourselves we discover. They might arouse powerful resistances. Which is why self-awareness&nbsp; work is often most effective in neutral or supportive environments where our defences are more relaxed. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The more work we do in this area the more realistic our self-image becomes the more we immunise ourselves&nbsp; against false fantasies from others or ourselves. We can’t force self-awareness on each other. It’s something we have to want for ourselves. Many people are irretrievably invested&nbsp; in some idealised fantasy self and they’ll continue to project their shortcomings onto others until the bitter end. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But as targets get to know themselves those bogus projections will&nbsp; begin to simply fall off them like water off glass. ‘Unless we resolve things, none of us will heal.’ This statement ticks lots of positive boxes. It suggests a far-reaching concern&nbsp; for everyone’s mental health. It acknowledges the existence of issues and affirms the need to sort through them if any progress is to be made not just sweep them unresolved under the rug and forget about them. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And it seems to reflect a&nbsp; lateral egalitarian orientation calling for peaceful cooperation and coexistence. In some cases of substantial ongoing hostilities — including civil and sectarian conflict — these sentiments are very real. There’s a genuine intention to&nbsp; work together to address grievances and restore previously eroded principles of responsibility, self-control, justice. But sometimes this statement has&nbsp; nothing to do with cooperation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Many targets hear it after&nbsp; ending an abusive relationship or when they’re walking out the door. Their abusers realise the threats that&nbsp; once kept them in line no longer work. So in a last-ditch effort to exert some influence they dangle therapeutic concepts like resolution, healing, closure, unity. Sometimes this message is&nbsp; delivered by someone else a family member, mutual acquaintance or some other misguided individual who’s been roped in to act on the abuser’s behalf. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Targets are sent letters and emails trying to plant insecurities in their minds suggesting if they don’t come&nbsp; back and try to work things out they’ll be forever haunted by guilt plagued by obsessive thoughts unable to move on. They’re told running away isn’t a solution they’ll just carry the same&nbsp; problems around with them and none of their relationships will succeed. Some targets even hear this kind of&nbsp; doom-mongering from their therapists. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
I strongly advise targets who do to get new ones who’ve been trained in abusive relationships and know what they’re talking about. One of the many insidious myths about abuse is that to resolve our feelings and experiences we need our abusers’ participation. We don’t. And that reality is born out&nbsp; by countless targets of abuse who heal and move on with&nbsp; no input from their abusers. Targets generally have all&nbsp; the information they need — often an overabundance of it. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Resolution isn’t about getting more information but processing the information&nbsp; they already possess. All the questions they have about their abuse — all the whys and the hows — are generally ones they can answer themselves. Their abusers have no valuable insights to offer and their participation just opens&nbsp; the door to more manipulation. And, just as targets don’t need&nbsp; their abusers’ participation to heal abusers don’t need their targets’ participation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Just like targets, abusers have&nbsp; all the information they need. If they really want to heal,&nbsp; no one’s stopping them. When it comes to self-affirmation targets and abusers are&nbsp; divided by a common language. Targets who use it to restore equality find themselves in conflict with abusers who twist it to demand special treatment. It can catch targets off balance having their own therapeutic concepts&nbsp; and phrases used against them. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This kind of disorientation is common in the bizarro world of the&nbsp; abuser where nothing matches up. Words don’t match actions. Image doesn’t match content. Targets need to cut to the underlying issue: are everyone’s freedoms and&nbsp; entitlements being acknowledged? The answer to that question will clarify whether the person is making&nbsp; healthy reasonable demands or weaponising self-affirmation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>
