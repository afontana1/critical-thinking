<p>
Just a quick note to alert you that a fake twitter account was recently created by someone, using my channel name and channel icon and responding to other users as me Several friends have reported this violation to twitter Obviously this kind of identity theft and online deception is nothing new And it just serves as another reminder to be wary of who we're interacting with when we're not face to face It's not always who we think For future reference; I'm not on twitter or facebook So you can be sure any profiles claiming to be me, or to speak on my behalf, are fake
