title: "The Stagnation of Philosophy"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
Imagine that you entered a medical university and sit in your first lesson. When an authoritatively looking professor approaches the pulpit, you are impatiently taking an aunt and a pen, in anticipation of the approaching amazing knowledge. “Welcome to the basics of medicine,” says the professor, “I think all, like me, in anticipation of the study of a huge and amazing world of treatment.” At first, everything seems to go normally, but soon you notice an alarming trend. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Instead of simply teaching students a modern understanding of the human body, the teacher is hung up on the strangest topics. For weeks, you are sitting through a heap of lectures about absolutely refuted practices, such as bloodletting, trepanation, phrenology and homeopathy. Finally, somewhere in the middle of the semester, the professor seems to switch to more sane topics, such as cell biology and microbial theory of diseases, but this is not for long. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And soon you again go deep into the medical theories of Feng Shuya, acupuncture and exorcism. Struck by this state of affairs, you are wondering, maybe this course is some special? Maybe the university simply wants to give students a historical context before teaching real practical things? Therefore, you decide to look at the university catalog and it turns out that the entire medical university is the same. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
To officially earn your medical qualification, you should attend classes such as “Medicine in literature”, “God, faith and treatment”, “women in early oncology”, “medieval pharmacology”, “Metammedicin”, “Eastern ophthalmology”, “Medical justice”, “Spirituality in cardiology”, “Review of early modern medicine”. After further study, you will eventually learn that this is not even a local phenomenon, This is a widespread practice in any accredited medical school around the Western world. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Of course, in this situation, the only reasonable reaction is to quit this whole nightmare and change their specialty, right? A reasonable reaction for everyone except philosophers. This may seem like an implausible script, but in reality, this is how modern philosophy is taught at the university level. In general, the courses of philosophy do not actually teach students of philosophy as such Instead, the majority of approaches to this subject are much better described as “the history of philosophy” or a review. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Of course, this can be an interesting information for some, but this is not a completely “concentrated generalization of a modern consensus that determines other areas.” To be honest, this is not necessarily something bad. If the history of philosophy is really interested in you, then study it for health. This may even have a real tangible value, and therefore there is nothing wrong with studying this as an end in itself. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But please, let's try to comprehend what really happens here. Formal education in philosophy does not actually qualify you as an authority in correct philosophical thought. In the best case, you will just make a co -painted historian and classifier. And much of this is intentionally, there is an open tradition in Western education, which says that it is always more important to teach students “how” to think, and not “what” to think. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
University philosophy, apparently, elevated this doctrine to extreme fanaticism. The questions themselves are often considered more interesting than the actual answers, And the act of thinking about arguments is widely considered as an important itself. Therefore, professors and textbooks spend huge forces on a comparative analysis of ideas, but rarely to establish which of them will be official opinion. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Consider for example the classic scriptures of the ancient "Stoicism" - A popular outlook on life that distinguishes self -control and stamina of the spirit as a way to happiness. Any student of philosophy will ultimately read about this teaching at some stage, as well as the views on him of his contemporaries of opponents. But if you ask your professor whether stoicism works at all or not, then you will most likely get an evasive answer. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
To illustrate: should I use stoicism for myself?Will stoicism improve my life and make me more successful? Will stoicism help me cope with the injury or overcome bad habits? Are there comparative studies that evaluate all this empirically? Damn him!Academic philosophy is not interested in choosing the parties and measuring efficiency, She only wants to explore how other people historically perceived the world. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
“Success” in a modern philosophical context often has very little in common with the practicality and content of the idea. Instead, the “success” of the idea is usually measured by the degree of its influence. Therefore, the question of the correctness or incorrectness of stoicism is not even raised, We study it because it was a very popular force that influenced many centuries of the development of ancient Western culture. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Again, there is nothing wrong with a similar methodology, provided that we honestly recognize it with what it is. In principle, you can be the greatest thinker in the world, who finally solved all the most important issues for the whole time, And each student of philosophy will still be forced to shove a huge bunch of lower content before he generally touches your ideas. In the same way, you can pile up 4,000 pages of an incoherent verbal vinaigrette, And all you need is to impress the right people so that your ideas are taught along with sane content. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
All this would be completely tolerant and even respectful, if not one “but”. Philosophers, both in professional and in amateur circles, are presented with an overly optimistic sense of their own importance. University faculties around the world openly boast of how philosophy teaches students such important skills as critical thinking, logical analysis, solving complex problems. They are proud of their supposedly impartial use of pure thoughts to create and evaluate arguments, and all for the development of a clear and systematic vision of the one we are, where we are, and where we need to go. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
All this sounds great in theory, but it turns out to be a complete fake. For demonstration, imagine the professional community of thousands of determined intellectuals, all highly qualified experts in the art of searching for truth. Now imagine that these same intellectuals all share the general purpose of the study of complex issues, collecting evidence, evaluating arguments and coming to the most reasonable conclusions of the possible. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Naturally, we should expect that such a group will eventually come to a unanimous consensus for each question posed, provided that they all share the same methods, the same goals, the same evidence and the same arguments. The very existence of the slightest disagreement would only prove that specific members of this community either do not follow the correct instructions, do not share the same evidence, or they are not sincere in their alleged search for truth. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The more disagreement appears, the more evidence will be that such a group neglects the establishment of consecutive standards of honest research. Now imagine that the same group can absolutely cannot converge on a single aspect of a banal fact, and you will finally get what is closely similar to modern philosophy. In the famous study of Bourget and Chalmers, hundreds of doctors of philosophy around the world were interviewed on various fundamental topics. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
You might think that if the philosophers are really such great experts in thinking, as they position themselves, then we should expect an overwhelming consensus on basic issues from their area. But the results were completely opposite!Not a single question could collect consensus above 90%, and only one question could exceed 80%. And we are not talking about strange esoteric problems, but fundamentally basic issues for the whole philosophy. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example: What is truth?What is knowledge?What is logic?Do we have free will?Is there good and evil? It is impossible to exaggerate that in almost any other professional field of research, this would be an absolute disgrace. But, when we are talking about academic philosophy, this is perceived completely normal. The last hundred years, the philosophical community has been engaged in research, doubts, argumentation, debate, assessment and training, But they still cannot fully converge on the existence of objective reality outside our sensory perception. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
What is even more shameful for the philosophical community, this is how many of traditionally “deep philosophical issues” have long been resolved by professionals from other fields. Let us consider for example the nature of morality and ethical behavior. Biologists and economists collectively solved this problem a decade ago, and together they came to the same basic description through independent directions of the study. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Personal interest in combination with social interdependence and limited resources naturally generates cooperative and prosocial behavior. And this is not a subject of serious controversy, but already reliably fixed area, with a full -fledged own mathematical formalism, laboratory experiments and applications in the real world. But to this day, we still find philosophers who are endlessly obsessed with whether there will be a turn of the arrows with a crime. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That is why academic philosophy has a far from brilliant reputation among professional scientists, engineers and the general public. One of the most famous examples of this discontent was even voiced by Professor Stephen Hawking himself when he publicly stated that "philosophy is dead." Note, he did not say that it is absolutely useless to study philosophy, But rather, he was dissatisfied with the inability of philosophers to commit progress and keep up with the times. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Cosmologists make amazing discoveries every day about the fundamental nature of space, time and even the very concept of causal relationship. But philosophers are still arguing about such banal issues as: what is the nature of existence? They do not solve any new problems, they simply retell the same senseless rhetoric for decades. Countless philosophers will conquer from the idea that their favorite profession can be dead, but the complete kindergarten of their counterarguments only confirms this position. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They say such empty things as “science is a section of philosophy” or that “Hawking himself adhered to controversial philosophical views”, Or that "this statement is generated by ignorance, it is inconsistent and irresponsible." This is just a huge stream of insults, straw stuffed animals and abstracts of attention, there are no attempts to understand, much less solving a emphasized problem. Philosophy - as a professional academic industry - does not reach progress. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
She does not solve any problems, and she makes no discoveries. Even the word "philosophy" is a terribly poorly defined concept. For demonstration, just ask yourself right now: "What is philosophy?" In other words, when I pass philosophical courses at the faculty of philosophy in order to earn my philosophical degree, What exactly am I studying?What knowledge and skills should I acquire in order to officially qualify as an expert in this area? What separates the study of philosophy from, for example, the study of physics or art? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
How can we make a distinction between a philosophical problem and scientific?How can we measure the difference between a good philosophy and a bad philosophy? You might think that academic philosophers could agree at least this, but even this is a warmly debited issue. For example, we consider the classic statement that philosophy is just “love of wisdom”. By this definition, who is not a philosopher at all?Which of us honestly hates wisdom and has no interest in understanding the world? At least one University Faculty is trying to clarify this doctrine, telling us that: 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
“Philosophy is an activity that people are engaged in when they seek to understand the fundamental truths about themselves, about the world in which they live, and their relationship with the world and with each other.” Well, if I go and get a doctoral degree on philosophy, will this really make me an expert in fundamental truths about me, the world and our relationship? If so, then why is it so difficult for this community to agree, what are these truths? Why are they not able to eradicate errors in their literature and just tell us facts? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In practice, a much more suitable definition for a philosopher is one who simply studies philosophy. And philosophy itself is determined by the approved training course, which all students should study for their philosophical degrees. This is a completely valid definition, and at least some university faculties imply it on their sites. But let's be honest about what follows. Philosophy, in all practical meanings, is nothing more than a set of arbitrarily assigned courses determined by the governing body of your specific university. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In practice, this usually comes down to an extensive review of the thoughts of culturally influential figures in history. Therefore, when I need help in comparison of the epistemological views of Immanuel Kant and David Home, I definitely consult a philosopher. But when it is necessary to determine whose views are more valid, functional and practical, I am even afraid of professional philosophers as unlawful as the rest. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Again, all this would be good and beautiful if it were not for the arrogant pretense, that modern academic philosophers are the great lords of all human wisdom. They want you to think that they all penetrate into the deepest secrets of life, the universe and everything else, but this picture is simply arrogant pretense. Every month, this community publishes huge volumes of literature in prestigious academic magazines, despite the lack of official consensus on how the correct answer looks, even if they find it. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is very bad.Charlatans, air sellers and simply incompetent people are the only ones who can generally be the benefit of such vague. When the professional area does not have any clear criteria for what is sane labor, then a bunch of useless delirium will be inevitable. Therefore, even if philosophy sometimes gives rise to valuable diamonds of truth, then this truth is almost impossible to find without first digging the colossal heaps of the useless rhetorical nonsense. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
A good example: Consider the famous philosopher Alvin Planning, which is widely recognized as one of the greatest living philosophers of religion for today. But if you work hard to read any of his works, they are almost crowded with the most insane nonsense that you can only find. This person really wrote a 90-page essay in defense of the statement that “it is absolutely correct, rationally, reasonably and fairly believed in God without any evidence and arguments in general.” And not just some god, notice, but specifically the Christian God from the Holy Bible. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
He also declares his other works that if you do not share his assessments about the “obviousness” of God, then this necessarily means that sin decomposes your brain and literally makes you stupid! That is, all these Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, atheists, Gentiles and Jews around the world can believe in what they believe, only because of idolatry, pride and masturbation. And these are not some notes of a madman, but widely recognized as Magnum Opus Planning. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Would you think that such a flagrant obscurable incompetence would have brought contempt for the author from the entire community of critically thinking experts?But no! Instead, he was practically showered with rewards, ranks and honors. Keep in your head that Professor Hawking and I myself am far from the only people who noticed these problems with philosophy, and many significant figures are hard to write about this in recent years. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, the question is not here, not of whether the “is at all” a problem, but how best to investigate this problem, and return this area to some kind of respectableness. It is also funny that the philosophers themselves, obviously, are the last people on the planet on which we can calculate to draw up such a solution. As a result, “philosophy” is just a word, which means that there is no objectively correct way to determine and protection. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Any answer that we will give will certainly be arbitrary, and there are dozens of competing schools thoughts about determining philosophy. At the same time, we will not forget that countless members of this community have a personal interest in maintaining this lack of standards, since this allows them, in fact, to receive a salary for nothing. And if philosophers want to be taken seriously as academically mature people, then sooner or later they will have to establish some boundaries. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Philosophy, obviously, is in dire need of its own philosophy. It is interesting when you pronounce this phrase, because it tells us well what the word "philosophy" usually indicates in practice. Namely, on a thorough formulation of the meaning and content of something. This even seems to be for granted when it is formulated like this.And if you know anything about modern philosophy, then you know that this is a priority principle of this profession. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Not just a search for definitions from a dictionary, but a comprehensive desire for conceptual clarity. For demonstration, consider the so -called "philosophy of science." In order to officially call yourself scientists, you most likely take the fundamental goals of science, and you agree to practice its methods. Science is not just a set of ready -made knowledge, but not the system of approved doctrines. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Science is a process that must be followed. Thus, the philosophy of science can be defined as a description of what science is;Why science is important;how science works;And how to determine those who cannot do science correctly. This philosophy does not even have to be final, and any person can freely give their own interpretation to the basic principles. It can be argued that all this itself can be just another philosophy, but at least it is a coordinated philosophy, which is well covered by what people usually mean when they use this word. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, the philosophy of education, the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of law, Moral philosophy, art, language, sports, politicians, even corporations have their own philosophy. Based on this, the “philosophy of philosophy” or simply “metaphylosophy” should explain in the same way what philosophers do;Why do they do it;What value does it have;And how to distinguish between competent and incompetent practitioners. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And what do you think, how is this community of professionals, doctors of philosophy, officially determined their area? Just!They did not.They really and honestly do not know what it means to be a philosopher, despite decades of personal commitment of this profession. And this is strange, because it is not so difficult to just observe the group of professionals at work and list the various tasks that they usually collectively engage in. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
As I see, most professional philosophers in the academic world, in fact, are simply cultural guardians. People argued about fundamental issues of the whole story, and there is a real value in the cataloging of various answers developed over time. In this context, it is simply not important if the community is unable to choose the right views, because the very idea of the correct philosophical position is simply meaningless here. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In the best case, we can only explore the views of influential figures, reformulate their statements more concisely, summarize various criticism, and let students find out what works better. If necessary, then we can then distinguish the “applied” category of philosophy, which is determined by the act of “doing” philosophy or simply philosophizing. Anyone can do this, and this is just a question of doing what we have established: a clear formulation of definitions, goals, values, premises, beliefs, etc. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For what follows a thorough study of confirming arguments, logical implications and practical consequences. “Successful” practitioners are already determined by their degree of cultural influence, but I think that we can also reasonably evaluate their merits by studying some objective criteria. For example, I personally think that good philosophers should clearly determine their terms, strictly formulate their arguments in accordance with the established “conclusion rules”, and show how their conclusions are significant for the problems of the real world. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In other words: what do you mean by this?How do you know that?And why should this interest anyone? Again, it can be just my personal philosophy, but at least this is a competent philosophy from an experienced professional scientist-engineer. Only because the goals and definitions are arbitrary, this does not mean that everyone is free to invent any self -serving nonsense, to their own taste. If you expect your ideas to be clear, substantial and convincing, then there are certain rules that you will have to learn to follow. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But if you are not worried about such qualities, then to health, bring any arbitrary absurdity that will come to mind. Just do not be surprised when the rest of the world cannot accept your conclusions. But who knows, maybe I am too simplifying.Maybe you have a completely different view of how philosophy should be determined. This is great, and I love to listen to all multiple different nuances from competing schools of thoughts. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But whatever views you have, let's stop fooling ourselves with pathos fantasies, that the so-called philosophers have some kind of magical understanding of fundamental truths in the world. Academic philosophy is not about what is correct and wrong, but about the study of issues themselves in some kind of cultural and historical context. If you consider philosophy this way, then it is quite fair to say that this area is well alive and well. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But if you want reliable and unambiguous answers, then sooner or later you will have to start installing some basic standards. In this sense, I am afraid that philosophy is quite definitely dead, because it was never originally alive. Science is the highest authority in this area, because science has real standards for how the correct answers should look. Therefore, science does not “need” philosophy in any literal sense, because science itself is a philosophy. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, while mainstream academic philosophers will not establish their own philosophy, they will always remain aloof, while other institutions are engaged in real labor, research and discoveries. [Translated vk.com/id79920293]
