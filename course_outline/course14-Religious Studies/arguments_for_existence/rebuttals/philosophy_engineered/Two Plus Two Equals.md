Philosophy with the engineering language. A review on the video of Dr. William L. Craig "God and mathematics." Why does mathematics work? Just think about it.Mathematical entities, for example, numbers, sets and equations are non -violent and abstract. They cannot give rise to anything. But for some reason, the physical universe functions mathematically. As Galileo said: "The Book of Nature is written in the language of mathematics." Why does mathematics work? This question has the same meaning for me as the question "Why does English work?" 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They work because we created them so that they work. And if they had not worked, then we would simply throw them out and invented something else that works. You yourself said that mathematics is a language. Each time it is important to remind themselves that specifically Christian apologists are trying to prove to us. According to the mainstream Christian theology, God should be a living embodiment of absolute goodness, power and love. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We are talking about a creature that is extremely strongly wishing to build a deep personal relationship with all of us, and which has no choice but to throw us into hell if we cannot reciprocate. Therefore, it is fair to assume that under such conditions it should be corny and simple. It’s like trying to prove the existence of the moon.You just need to look at the sky and immediately see it personally. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But instead, what we have in practice is a bunch of vague philosophical piles. God exists because ... mathematics works? The very formulation of this argument actually demonstrates its glaring groundlessness. Let's leave all this away.It is nice to see that apologists finally depart from standard “top 5” arguments in favor of the existence of God. And since this video is from the Movement Vera movement, it is fair to assume that Dr. William Lane Craig himself is the brain of this event. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, you can imagine my disappointment when the philosopher of the PHD level completely fails on the most basic philosophical principles. For example, ask yourself right now, what does it mean to say that mathematics works? Of course, we have vague intuitive ideas about the meaning of this, but nowhere in this video Craig does not lay out in detail. Moreover, Craig also does not explain at all what he means by “mathematics”. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Those.What is mathematics in reality?Where does it come from?How does it work? He knows very well that there are many competing schools of thought on these issues, and we do not have a way to determine what is supposed in this discussion. And this is such a glaring gap that I cannot get rid of suspicions that he does it purposefully. After all, what can be a more effective way to reach dubious assumptions than to intentionally avoid any solid definitions? Therefore, before considering this video further, we need to establish the ontological status of mathematics. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Mathematics, as a majority of relevant professionals in this field understands, is nothing more than a set of formal languages and deductive systems built on axioms and the rules of conclusion. Logic, numbers, sets, algebra, geometry and everything else from this area was directly invented by people. The process of this invention itself is commonplace to demonstrate, and in modern textbooks there are practically no serious disagreements on these issues. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Note also how Craig himself actually openly confirms this view through his automatic approval of Galileo's quote. "The book of nature is written in the language of mathematics." Although Galileo may have said this in a poetic sense, but Craig apparently wants us to interpret this comment literally. As if he thinks that mathematics is somehow woven into the fabric of space and time itself. But at the moment of taking a look that mathematics is a language, it immediately becomes obvious to us how mathematics can work so well. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If the universe exists, then such an existence should manifest itself through our sensory experience. We people invented a language to bring each other this experience separated by us, And we can use this language to formulate the tested empirical predictions. Then mathematics is the term that we gave for various systems of formal languages designed to improve accuracy and reliability, and to eliminate ambiguity. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Nothing in this process does not say and implies anything about any “supernatural” creatures, And this means that any arguments in favor of this are already failing in advance without even starting. But who knows?Maybe I'm in a hurry with conclusions?Therefore, let's see how the professional PhD philosopher with his own team of first -class animators will be able to derive the existence of God from mathematics. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Scientists do not use mathematics simply as a convenient way to streamline data. They believe that mathematical relations reflect the real aspects of the physical world. Science relies on the assumption that we live in an ordered universe, which is regulated by accurate mathematical laws. Therefore, all the laws of physics are expressed by mathematical equations. Let's figure out what they have heard. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
To begin with, Paul Davis is not the Holy Patriarch of all science and engineering. The fact that this person is a famous cosmologist does not mean that he speaks for all scientists from all disciplines forever and ever. It is likely that Dr. Davis can generally have little formal training in the basics of mathematical logic, theory of numbers, the theory of evidence, or the philosophy of mathematics. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Contrary to popular belief, these are not the objects that physicists must master for their profession. Therefore, he does not have any official authority in these topics, And I am sure that we can find many other famous scientists who disagree with similar opinions. And if the Craig was generally hard to read the very article from which this quote comes, Then he would find that Paul Davis himself openly question her validity. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
He makes this statement only as a rhetorical springboard from which its possible erroneity can be explored. But let's leave this unscrupulous pulling out quotes.And what exactly does it mean to say that mathematical relations reflect the real aspects of the physical world? It sounds cool, but somehow vague, isn't it? For example, I can describe the world using ordinary English statements, and these statements can also “reflect reality” in a sense, isn't it? This is a classic philosophical concept, known as the “correspondent theory of truth” (correspondence theory). 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But this does not necessarily mean that English itself is metaphysically rooted in the fundamental structure of being. So why does Dr. Craig hints to us like mathematics? Mathematical statements, even with all their technical accuracy, are still just statements. And this means that there is nothing magical or amazing in their ability to describe our experience. This is that all languages should do. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Another strange statement that deserves a strict analysis is the idea that we live in an “ordered universe”. Because when I checked the last time, there are many aspects of our universe, which are regulated by complete chaos and accident. And what is surprising, we just have mathematical languages for describing these things too! Or did all these university courses on the theory of chaos and the theory of probability just mean? The very idea that mathematics and orderliness are inseparable is simply erroneous. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
I see the situation in such a way that when physicists, for example, Professor Davis, they say about the “ordered universe”, they usually mean that we live in a “deterministic” universe. In other words, the universe in which existing initial conditions can be used to predict some future state. How can mathematical theory work in this context? This means that we can use it to predict the future from some given set of initial conditions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And how can this be called “admission” if people observe this from the dawn of times? At the same time, we also know that this principle is not universal, because the subatomic particles are demonstrated in their fundamental behavior. It is funny that Dr. Craig is trying to build his position on such a prerequisite, despite the fact that Christian theology requires him to accept the doctrine of "libertarian free will." And as any philosopher-student knows, the very definition of free will is exactly the opposite of the concept of the deterministic universe. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, without the concept of which Craig is trying to achieve this prerequisite, despite the fact that it only serves as proof against his own theology. Pythagoras discovered that when a vibrating string is shortened by half, she plays the same note, but on the octave above. Observations of Isaac Newton led him to the discovery of the law of gravity - a mathematical attitude, expressed by a simple equation that allowed us to enter the age of space travel. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Mathematics allowed astronomers to determine the situation of a previously unarmed planet. And James Clerk Maxwell used mathematics to predict the existence of radio waves. Albert Einstein, working with theoretical mathematics, developed half a century before him, formulated his “general theory of relativity” - the foundation of modern physics. His calculations were later confirmed during a solar eclipse, when Arthur Eddington watered as light from distant stars is sparkled with our sun. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Then Peter Higs used mathematical equations to predict the existence of an elementary particle. And it took 48 years, billions of dollars and millions of man-hours of the work of experimenters, in order to finally record Bozon Higs. Remember how just a minute ago Craig just told us that mathematical relations reflect the real aspects of the physical world. Then why does he refer to known errors to prove his position? Newton's worldwide gravity is erroneous. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It cannot correctly describe the behavior of gravity, and we have known this for more than 100 years. It is only approximately reliable under specific specific conditions. It does not predict a slowdown in time, it does not predict gravitational waves, it does not predict gravitational lenses, and it does not predict the precession of the orbit of Mercury. Einstein's theory is why Newton's laws replaced. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And even in this theory there are known shortcomings, because it cannot be agreed by some predictions of quantum mechanics. Well, by what universal logic does it make sense to bring erroneous and mutually incompatible theories as evidence that mathematics reflects reality? It is also difficult for me to ignore the obvious manipulation of Chernipiking in this video. Even if some mathematical theories allow us to make reliable empirical predictions, this does not mean that all of them can. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For each successful mathematical theory, dozens of, if not hundreds of disastrous theories that were mathematically formulated in parallel. And what exactly does this tell us about the nature of mathematics when there are much more unsuccessful theories than successful? Does Dr. Craig know nothing about Ptolemy's astronomy with its geocentric solar system and confusing epicycles? Does he know anything about the luminous air?Or the coordinate transformations of Galileo?Or about an ultraviolet disaster?Or a vacuum disaster? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Again, it is important to remember that mathematics is just a language.I can use mathematics to describe the actual state of things in the universe, And I can use mathematics to describe a completely false universe, which violates any logic. Some mathematical theories are simple and elegant, while others are computational nightmares of the chaos of instability. Sometimes I want to describe perfectly ordered systems that obey absolute determinism, and sometimes I want to describe something completely unpredictable and random. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Mathematics can all this.That is why it is impossible to bring anything about God from such a premise. How will we explain the amazing applicability of mathematics on the physical world? I will show you something."It is raining outside." I have just applied a completely non -mathematical English statement to the physical world. But for some strange reason, I do not see that Christian apologists are in a hurry to prove the existence of God from this. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, let's not fool ourselves with fantasies that there is something magical in this. The world manifests itself through my sensory experience, and I can use language statements to describe this experience accordingly. If this world is determined in some kind of philosophical sense, then probably I can use statements to design a model, And this model will allow me to make reliable empirical predictions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The only thing that mathematics adds to this whole picture is the ability to construct very specific statements in formal structure. For example, the rain pours at a speed of two inches per hour, and tomorrow it will reach a maximum one inch per hour more. This means applying mathematics to the physical world. Mathematics itself did nothing but gave a formal structure to my statements. And whether these statements correspond to reality, this is a completely separate issue. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
You can be the greatest theoretic physicist of all times, solve the equations of the Schrödinger on the horizon of events of the black hole, And this in the same way describes the fundamental essence of your work. The scientific model is as good as it has the ability to make tested empirical predictions, and the formal language through which you can express them helps. In 1960, the physicist and mathematician Eugene Wigner, who received the Nobel Prize, published an article that struck the scientific community, under the name: 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
"The incomprehensible effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences." Vigner concluded that the effectiveness of mathematics is a miracle that we do not understand and do not deserve. This is the third time in two minutes, when a physicist is directly quoted in this video to support argumentation. And I think this is flagrantly two -faced, because William Lane Craig laid the bolt on the philosophical opinions of professional scientists. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, Professor Sean Carroll, the famous cosmologist who repeatedly argued the position that "God is a bad theory." Or for example, the famous physicist and mathematician Stephen Hawking, and his well -known positions that “God does not exist, no one created the universe, and no one runs our fate.” The scientific community in the vast majority according to the fact that “God” is unacceptable for science, because “God” does not explain anything, It cannot be measured, it cannot be observed, and it does not give any empirical predictions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But despite all this, Dr. Craig absolutely does not sway the scientific consensus on this issue. So why is he so willingly relied on the authority of scientists in this case, when is it about this philosophical feature of mathematics? This is striking, because it is still so irresponsible in this matter. The scientific community was absolutely not “affected” by the article by Vigner, Because there are dozens of scientific publications in which his conclusions are specifically refuted. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In general, the majority of the scientific community do not even suspect its existence. Scientists, engineers and mathematicians usually pay little attention to philosophy, and most concentrate on research, instead of such useless nonsense. The personal inability of Eugene Wigner to provide an explanation for some obscure phenomenon, does not automatically prove the existence of magic! In contrast to what Dr. Craig wants to convince you, Eugene Wignet is also not a “pope” for science! If a person has learned the Nobel Prize in Physics, this does not mean that the rest of the scientific community should unanimously obey his conclusions about the existence of miracles. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Why is mathematics so effective? Philosophers who consider this issue are divided into two camps. “Naturalists” who believe that everything is really existing is a space-time and its filling. They exclude supernatural causes. And the “theists” who believe in God who created the universe. This is almost a children's level of primitivization.And Craig knows this. There is a huge variety of philosophical nuances on this topic, including Platonism, logicism, formalism, structuralism, intuitionism, and many more and many times. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And I even agree that many of them are failed, but you can’t rake them together in such a wide category as naturalism. This is an absurd dichotomy, which reduces the whole problem to the choice between "God did this" and "God did not do it." I will answer this with a simple question: Are there such cases in the history of science that the use of a supernatural explanation improves our understanding of anything? By definition, supernatural causality in principle cannot serve as a coordinated model, because supernatural entities cannot be verified. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They do not follow any causal relationship, they are beyond any logical description, They cannot be observed and calculated, and they do not give any empirical predictions. They do not serve as any scientific and philosophical goals, except to destroy any further study. Therefore, “God did this” is the most useless explanation that can only be imagined in the field of science or philosophy. Naturalists cannot provide a reasonable explanation of why mathematics is applicable to the physical world. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is just a "happy coincidence."But this is not an explanation. I have never encountered any scientist, engineer, mathematician or philosopher who thinks that all this is just a happy coincidence, that mathematics works. This statement is nothing more than a shamefully ridiculous straw scarecrow, completely fabricated by the imagination of Craig. There are many detailed explanations in philosophical literature, And I even summarized the most recognized theories in the entry to this analysis. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Craig either just lies, or he is unforgivable on this topic. In the best case, naturalists can say that this is not surprising that mathematics is applicable to the physical world, Since it was just so by chance that the world has a mathematical structure, and therefore, of course, mathematics applies to it. It is convenient that Dr. Craig thinks that you can simply categorically reject any existing naturalistic theories of mathematics with a simple go -up. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Moreover, this is a complete misleading to say that the Universe "has a mathematical structure." As we have already established, mathematics is a language, people can use the language to describe the universe, and this language may or not have a mathematical structure. The universe itself does not care about either one or the other. She is simply what she is and does what she does. But no matter what the Universe does, this behavior should manifest itself empirically for us, which means that we can always invent a formal language to describe this. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But this explanation is unsatisfactory for two reasons. The first is that a huge part of mathematics in science cannot be physically implemented. For example, “purely imaginary numbers” and “endless spaces”. Although these concepts are useful, physical reality in principle cannot have the structure described by them. And the second, these answers still do not explain why the physical universe has such an amazingly elegant mathematical structure. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This whole section is simply insane absurden for me. Remember that Dr. Craig invariably and stubbornly emphasized the "mathematical structure of the physical universe." Then, for some incomprehensible reason, he completely undermines this premise, suddenly denying the physics of mathematics. Now he says that the “huge part” of mathematics cannot be “physically implemented”, as if another part could? He openly declares that some mathematical concepts are “useful”, although they are not “physic”, and then continues to repeat how amazing all this mathematics is physically physically. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, in my soul I can’t imagine what Dr. Craig carries. What does it mean for mathematics to be physic, in contrast not physic? Should it necessarily describe the physical structure?How can I distinguish physically realized mathematics from unrealized mathematics? Again, we can solve all this misunderstanding, just accepting that mathematics is a language. This is not some objectively real independent thing, but this is something that you do. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Nouns, verbs and adjectives also cannot be “physically implemented” only if you do not mean by this their daily usations in speech. But as far as I understand, apologists are not in the same reverence from the basic functionality of English grammar. Therefore, I do not see any reasonable reasons for them to behave completely opposite when mathematics does absolutely the same thing. In contrast, for theists, mathematics works so well in the physical world, because God decided to create a world, in accordance with the project according to His reasonable plan. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is an exemplary example of classical logical manipulation, called "god of white spots." This is essentially simply a special case of an “argument from ignorance”, and it looks as follows: PROPRAME 1: Naturalists cannot explain how mathematics works.Conclusion: therefore, God did it. If such an argument is used by a student-philosopher on the exam, then the teacher will leave it for the second year. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Such moments make you think about how such a person as William Lane Craig, in principle, could get his phd. Faculties of religious philosophy simply distribute them to anyone? It doesn’t matter how bad you consider modern naturalistic theories. As long as you have no convincing and based on evidence of the argument of your position, you also cannot be considered right. So what evidence Craig can provide in defense of his statement that it was just God that did this? The Jewish philosopher of the first century, Philon of Alexandria, proposed the following analogy: 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
When the king wants to build a city, the trained architect first develops in his mind a project of all elements of the city that needs to be built. Then he begins to build a city of stones and wood, checking with the model, and making sure that material objects are erected according to the project. Mathematics and physics work so harmoniously together, because the same mind that designed the Universe in a mathematical model also built the universe according to the same mathematical model. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And it's all!It was all his confirming argument.The only appeal to the analogy. The universe looks like mathematical, because the king will never build a city without a project. As if nothing in the natural world can never demonstrate any empirical predictability without the obligatory planning of some supernatural being. So that man was right, mathematics is a miracle, and God exists.Shah and Mat, naturalists! It is already a shame that this is the classic mistake “god of white spots”, but what amazes me the most, this is that there are even no “white spots” here. 
</p>
</div>
