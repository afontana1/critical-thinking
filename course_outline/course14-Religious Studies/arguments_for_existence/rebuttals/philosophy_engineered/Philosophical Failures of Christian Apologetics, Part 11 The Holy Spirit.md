title: "Philosophical Failures of Christian Apologetics, Part 11 The Holy Spirit"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
Put yourself in the shoes of a typical true Christian believer. You visit the church, study your Bible and accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and the Savior. Let us also imagine that you are a philosophically sophisticated person who loves to study arguments from all sides of the dispute. Therefore, you come across a video series of a video called "Philosophical failures of Christian apologetics" and happily decide to watch them all from beginning to end. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For the sake of further discussion, let's just assume that everything in this series is absolutely flawless in presentation and, therefore, completely convincing. All these loud, sophisticated arguments in favor of the existence of God are now officially exposed to your personal satisfaction. The “burden of evidence” lies on theists, who should positively prove the existence of God, and all of them decisively could not cope with this burden. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Moreover, you even learned how science actually explains the development of religion as a purely natural by-product of human psychology and cultural group selection. Of course, given all these philosophical circumstances, a true believer, like you, must find sufficient reasons to abandon his faith and accept more secular views, right? In fact, not, because if you really were a “true believing” Christian, then all these evidence, arguments and philosophical constructions would not mean anything. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
You did not admonish yourself in your faith, which means that you definitely cannot be reasoned from it. True Christian faith is not based on intellectual grounds, but on the incorrigible “evidence of the Holy Spirit”: “And my point of view here is as follows. The way I came to know the truth of Christianity was based primarily on the testimony of the Holy Spirit in my heart, And this gives me a self -confirming way of knowing the truth of Christianity, completely separated from evidence. " “But I think the way we fundamentally know that our faith is true is through the inward witness of the Holy Spirit. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
My faith in Christ is not based on arguments and evidence, although I have arguments and evidence. It is based on the internal evidence of the Holy Spirit. " “And therefore, if in some historically determined circumstances the evidence available to me will turn against Christianity, I don't think it will refute the testimony of the Holy Spirit." And so we come to our 11th philosophical failure of Christian apologetics — the idea that warm and fuzzy experiences can outweigh all reason, evidence and arguments to the contrary. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Such confessions are frighteningly common in the entire Christian world, and they tend to appear in several different versions. For example, look at the popular Statements of Faith, where Christian organizations openly boast of an a priori certainty that is absolutely infallible and therefore cannot change under any circumstances. Some philosophers even tried to formalize this doctrine under the guise of sophisticated academic philosophy, as it was with the famous “reformed epistemology” by Alvin Planting. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Even ordinary and nominal Christians are often happy to support such a doctrine by publicly declaring that "nothing can shake my faith." But whatever it is formulated, the main message is always the same - I'm right. I know I'm right. I absolutely cannot be wrong, and nothing you say or do will ever convince me otherwise. Therefore, ultimately it becomes clear that “Christian philosophy” is actually not at all a philosophy. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
“Western philosophy”, taught at each modern university, is built on a valiant tradition of asking questions, challenging our assumptions, and then follow arguments where they did not. The apologists, on the other hand, apparently think that philosophy is built on a mechanical repetition of the statements of the Holy Doctrine, followed by the unshakable protection of this doctrine, no matter what. By the way, that is why apologists are called "apologists." This word itself comes from the Greek "apology", which means "speech in defense." 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, many apologetics organizations openly declare themselves to be literal “defenders of the faith.” This is wonderful if you are someone like a lawyer who, by law, is obliged to defend the client, but not when your goal is to find out the truth. An honest study does not work if we do not actively seek out mistakes in our understanding, so that they can be corrected over time. Consider once again these classic “top 5” arguments that apologists love to defend so: "Ontological argument", "cosmological argument", 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
“Teleological argument”, “Argument from the thin setting” and “Moral argument”. Ask yourself: What purpose do these arguments even serve? By their own admission, most apologists have not actually been convinced by any of this nonsense, so what gives them the naive impression that we should be convinced by them? They almost openly boast of that neither evidence nor arguments played any role in their beliefs, And only a combination of warm, fluffy sensations and pure willpower. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is not a good faith debate, but an automatic admission that Christian apologists are deliberately two-faced, and they know it! It's ironic that apologists are so strangely reticent about all this "Special Testimony" because in principle it is a really compelling argument. Because if God is real, and if God truly wants to have a deep personal relationship with us, then what better way to demonstrate this fact than by personally opening yourself to your creations? This is all the skeptical community has been asking for all this time. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
- an empirically repeatable demonstration of the existence of God! Nevertheless, for some strange reason, both professionals and newcomers among apologists, as if with all their might try to avoid any mention of this before a skeptical audience. Read any book, listen to any lecture or see any formal debate, and this is nothing but endless rhetoric about the first causes, the maximum greatness and the transcendental, the immaterial, the extra-spatial, the timeless and so on. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This “spirit”, if it is generally mentioned, is usually nothing more than a belated philosophical addition. But then ask the apologists directly, what ultimately convinced them to believe, and it is completely normal to suddenly hear stories of personal revelation from God Himself! It’s like an ace in a sleeve that finally solves the problem once and for all, but they always play it only when it costs nothing. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
One might well think that apologists collectively share an unspoken understanding that “it just may be” that the Holy Spirit is not such a philosophically sound thing as they pretend to be. But what is the Holy Spirit really? Because if we're going to talk about this thing in serious detail, it's important to establish what exactly this idea is. And according to mainstream Christian doctrine, the Holy Spirit is simply the “Third Person of the Holy Trinity.” What this means in practice is that any experience with the Holy Spirit is quite literally a direct communication from God Himself. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
After all, God is a single being, consisting of three completely separate but equal persons, each of which individually is also God. If this all seems a little strange to you, just remember that this is an absolutely fundamental doctrine of orthodox Christianity. This is an unusual concept that began in the fourth century when some guy had the audacity to claim that Jesus Christ was separate from and subordinate to God the Father. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
You might think that such a trivial piece of theology could be discussed peacefully, but obviously this was an extremely heated and bitter political conflict. Fortunately, the facts on this issue were finally established through the time-honored tradition of “Voting on the Facts,” followed by the standard government suppression of any further dissent. It therefore goes without saying that this is an absolutely agreed upon and trustworthy fact about God about which there can be no further dispute. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If we leave aside this whole snowball of philosophical problems for now, what exactly is it like to “Receive an Experience of the Holy Spirit”? How can I recognize his presence?Can I sit next to him and somehow interact? Maybe talk to him or shake his hand?Does its presence have any measurable effect on the temperature? Or air pressure? Or against background radiation? Will it work miracles on demand? No, of course not.In the end, the spirit is an intangible creature, which means that nothing he does will ever give tangible, empirical manifestation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is a classic sign of our old friend, "Substance Dualism", according to which the Universe is clearly divided into two completely separate categories of fundamental things. The first category of things is our familiar material universe, consisting of atoms, quarks, electrons and photons, which do their job in accordance with the laws of physics throughout space and time. The second category of things consists of the consciousnesses themselves, or "matter of the mind", Which, apparently, simply flutters around and thinks on its own, completely regardless of any physical laws or material interactions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
However, it can apparently interact with other matters of the mind, and this is probably why this “personal experience of the Holy Spirit” is limited to extremely subjective impressions. For example, some people describe this Spirit as "...barely noticeable intrusions, almost like a thought in your head that wasn’t actually your own but was put there by an outside force.” Others can describe this as "... the innate awareness of the existence of God - as if we all had the sixth sense of the divine presence in the world around us." 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Some people report feelings of intense euphoria, as if they were being "taken over by an electric frenzy of pure joy." Others may testify that they have heard the voice of God directly, as a real sound, from another person in the room. Others can describe this as “burning in the chest” or “numbness of thought”. Some people even declare the ability to “speak languages”, as if the spirit masters their bodies and gives them the power to speak the language of angels. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
So, right out of the gate, the very idea of ​​a “special witness” from the Holy Spirit is already on hopelessly shaky foundations. We cannot even speak of this Spirit without first presupposing vast mountains of doubtful and incoherent doctrines, And each alleged contact with him is almost always vague. Those who claim to have experienced it cannot agree on what it should be like, and what it usually "feels like" is either boringly ordinary or frighteningly deranged. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The only agreed upon rule seems to be that "you'll just know it when you feel it," and as long as it leads you to good Christian works, then the rest doesn't matter. But before you dismiss all this in frustration, it is important to acknowledge the fact that the people who share these experiences are usually completely sincere. Moreover, it is not difficult to find similar evidence from around the world and throughout history. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, something is causing this phenomenon, and it is important to ask yourself what exactly could this cause be? Are these experiences the result of actual supernatural communication? Or is it just another natural human characteristic? This may seem like a simple question, but you will be amazed at how incredibly difficult it can be for apologists to distinguish between “Experience” and “Reason.” We have many personal testimonies of these "spiritual contacts" and all of them are immediately declared true by the principle of "Mental Incorrigibility" 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
— I had an experience, this experience was very unique, and therefore I decide to label this experience as the “Special Testimony of the Holy Spirit.” However, it is a completely different matter to attribute such experiences to an external cause, that is, telepathic communication with the spaceless, timeless, omnipotent Creator of the Universe, who also happens to be the God of the Bible. This is already a “synthetic judgment”, which means that the rules of “appointment of truth” are now completely different. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
I find it amazing how guys with actual PhDs in philosophy consistently have difficulty with one of the most basic principles in all of philosophy - in this case with the principle of “Skepticism towards the Outside World”. All it says is that no synthetic proposition can ever truly be "known" with "absolute, unshakable certainty" Because there will always be an infinite set of possible explanations for our sensory data. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
At best, we can only reach tentative conclusions based on the prevailing empirical data and predictive models. So even if thousands of people do go through some intense "spiritual experience," that doesn't mean we should immediately assume a supernatural cause for it. and also this assumption does not outweigh all further evidence and arguments forever. It is impossible to exaggerate the well -known fact that human sensory perception is easily allowed to deceive. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
There are hundreds, if not thousands of well -documented illusions, heuristics, bias, distortions, hallucinations and disorders with which the cognitive systems of completely normal people abound. Many of these illusions are almost identical copies of supposed manifestations of the Holy Spirit, And many other of them can even be caused on demand in the controlled laboratory conditions. Some Christians even openly admit to believing in real, literal "Demons" that run around imitating the Holy Spirit for their own sinister purposes. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It is therefore quite reasonable to assume that Christians, more than anyone else, should feel especially motivated to carefully examine all this "special evidence" Otherwise, we can all be trapped in the cunning deception of the devil himself. This is why people invented "Science". Despite the inherent fallibility of our subjective perceptions, it is still possible to generate real, actionable knowledge with a high degree of practical confidence. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
All we have to do is follow a few simple rules. For example, one of the most important rules in the philosophy of science is the principle of “Reproducibility”. In other words, if the Holy Spirit is really real, and if God really wants us to all feel His presence, then apparently I don't have to just take your word for it every time it happens. I personally should be able to reproduce this experience for myself, and there should be a simple procedure that I can follow in order to generate further experiments on demand. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Unfortunately, this is not the case in this case. There is no universally prescribed method by which the Holy Spirit can be invoked, And this means that there is no way to formally establish any causal relationship with his behavior. On the contrary, most encounters with the Spirit seem completely random, as if God is a capricious child who shares his presence only with some people and not with others. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Even in those rare cases when a specific procedure is proposed, it inevitably fails to reproduce the expected results. For example, one of the most striking illustrations of this problem can be found in the theology of the saints of the last days, which claims that everyone can get the experience of the Holy Spirit for themselves. All that needs to be done is to read the book of Mormon, reflect on her message, have a little faith, and then ask God in prayer, is it true. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If done correctly, God will supposedly reveal the truth to you personally through the power of the Holy Spirit. Great.Now raise your hands, how many of you are Mormons, Nemormons and former Mormons have tried this, but did not experience the promised results immediately? Right. Millions of you! The vast majority of people who try to repeat this experiment absolutely cannot reproduce the result. Which brings us to another key principle of modern philosophy of science: Falsifiability. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If people consistently follow the formula you prescribe and then fail to get the promised results, then we can immediately conclude that your claim is false. It doesn't matter how elegant your theory may be, and it doesn't matter how good it makes you feel. The world doesn't officially work according to the rules you describe, which means you're objectively and demonstrably wrong. But what about the people who still get the promised results? We can't just discount their experiences entirely. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Maybe we just completed the procedure incorrectly, or maybe there are hidden variables that we simply could not take into account. This is normal, that is why science has provided another rule to help us check their statements: “consistency”. In other words, if people actually produce expected results, then presumably those results should be internally consistent with each other, right? But, of course, this is also not true in this case. For every Mormon who claims to know the truth by the power of the Holy Spirit, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
there are an equal number of Baptists, Pentecostals, Jehovah's Witnesses and others who all say exactly the same thing about their religions and with equal conviction. However, all of them cannot be right, because the doctrines of salvation for one faith are often godless heresies for another. Which leads us to another fundamental principle in the philosophy of science - “savings” (also known as “razor of Occam”). 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In the presence of several explanations of the same phenomenon, each of which has the same explanatory power is always preferable to the one that has the smallest number of assumptions. So, given the fact that people all over the world regularly have experiences of supposedly spiritual nature, then what explanation, in your opinion, makes more sense? That a capricious God manifests himself completely at random, using inconsistent and subtle impressions to support mutually incompatible conclusions? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Or what, “can simply be”, people have a natural tendency to generate these experiments completely independently? Remember that this is still a completely reasonable question, even if the Holy Spirit is really real. So let's be extremely generous and just assume that a small subset of all these experiences are indeed perfectly legitimate. Obviously, apologists should still recognize the fact that millions of other people still have similar, but false experiments, for completely natural reasons. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
I myself have personally experienced countless psychological abnormalities, intense euphoria, deep feelings of guilt, Vague intuitive insights and even frank voices, but it never occurred to me that something of this was the result of a supernatural telepathy! It is completely normal to have such experiences, this is not something unhealthy, and almost every person receives them on a regular basis. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This quiet voice is in your head, taking care of you, encouraging you to make the right decisions;It was not a magical incorporeal spirit.It was you yourself all this time! There's a lot more going on in your head than pure conscious thinking. At any time, your brain is immersed in the perception of your environment, building ties and reaction to stimuli, and he does all this without direct permission from your conscious Self. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And this is very good. We don't always have the luxury of carefully thinking through complex problems, but instead must respond in the moment with pure intuition. However, this same intuition is only as good as we train it, And that is why religious organizations are so persistently fighting to mix this intuition with supernatural prejudices. It is a deliberate ploy to bypass our rational mind and replace it with impulsive, uncritical submission. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
So how exactly do you think apologists respond when faced with such an overwhelming preponderance of contradictions, null results, and alternative theologies? Most of the time they don't even talk about it at all - as if it never occurred to them that there were other religions, Or that other believers can have the same conviction as their own, or that some people may simply honestly not be able to reproduce any “spiritual contacts”. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is similar to an institutionalized rejection of ordinary human experience, where the spiritual manifestations of other people are simply ignored or denied. Then, on the rare occasions when they do pluck up the courage to acknowledge the question, the responses are almost comical in their smug arrogance and outright contempt! For example, "Reformed Epistemology" adheres to the existence of a "Sensus Divinitatis", or "Divine Sense", which unambiguously reveals the existence of God to everyone. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And not just “any” God, mind you, but the Christian God from the Holy Bible. Thus, anyone who declares ignorance of the truth of Christianity “does not have an excuse” and therefore can be immediately rejected as a damned liar. Or, in another case, if they are really sincere, then this should be the result of a failure in their divine feeling -Almost like a certain “spiritual blindness”, when our congenital receptors of God simply clog in somehow. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
However, the only thing that can supposedly cause such a problem is sin, which means we can now dismiss all such people as a bunch of evil Hitlers who simply love evil more than God. Or in another case, if you still experience the Holy Spirit, but simply not in the same religious context as they, Then, obviously, you should be mistaken!Because the Holy Spirit is unmistakable for those who really feel it, And this means that everything you think you felt was surely some kind of spiritual fake. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Here it is, please.According to the mainstream Christian apologists, all those Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Gentiles, animists, atheists And all the rest throughout history who could not turn to Christianity, or spiritually blind, are intellectually dishonest, or simply frankly sinful. So let's stop walking around the bush and just summarize this doctrine, how is it? - We are right, you are wrong, and if you don’t agree, then you are stupid and evil. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is indeed the absolute foundation for most Christian apologists. They know it and they admit it. It is difficult to fully articulate how terribly dangerous such a doctrine could be. When people stop acknowledging their own fallibility, then it is only a matter of time before violent bigotry enters the equation. By definition, dogmatic cannot be called to the mind, and a false doctrine can never be protected reasonably. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, the mind itself cannot settle any disputes, which leaves rough authority as the only working alternative. Which is even worse, the act of disagreement itself is interpreted not as a simple intellectual misunderstanding, but always as a moral decomposition. Unbelievers are automatically considered to be guilty of unsuitable crimes only because of their unbelief. Forcibly oppression, thus, is easily justified, which makes violent resistance inevitable necessity. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
So, in the end, the Holy Spirit is another shameful bunch of philosophical failures, painted in socially dangerous tones. We are talking about an absolute, unshakable conviction in insanely absurd doctrines, born entirely of fluffy subjective sensations, Which every competing religion on Earth can obviously reproduce, only then to lie about all this post -fact, pretending to be a serious academic dispute! This is a shameless betrayal of everything that is defended by Western philosophy. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is the exploitation of vulnerable human psychology, it is a demonization of unbelievers, this is an excuse for violence and it is a rejection of all known standards of honest inquiry. This does not allow any opportunity to correct errors, which means that any errors available will remain errors forever, because the mistakes mean nothing. Truth does not matter for these people, but only the imposition of conformism. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Even the very word "spirit" linguistically gives out the glaring absurdity of all this doctrine with giblets. Spirit comes from the Latin word spiritus, meaning breath and air. The Bible itself often refers to the Holy Spirit by name through the Greek word pneuma, which also carries the meaning of breath, wind and air. Even in the Jewish sections of the Old Testament, the Spirit of God is often mentioned as “Ruah”, which means breathing and wind. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is not a random coincidence.Ancient cultures almost everywhere equalized the wind and breath with the idea of the spiritual essence of life. For example, the Chinese word to refer to spiritual life strength - “qi”, and it is also translated as air and breathing. Ancient Indian philosophy uses the Sanskrit word "prana" to describe a cosmic life force associated with breathing. Ancient -noskandinavian languages often used terms such as önd and andi, to designate breathing and soul. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The obvious explanation is that ancient people did not understand how the air works, and therefore they simply filled the gaps with any observations that they could. For example, air can be felt, but not to see, and strong breathing seems very similar to the wind. Living creatures tend to breathe a lot, and that which dies, generally stops breathing. The only natural conclusion is that the air itself should consist of a mysterious vital essence that animates living beings. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Thus, air, breathing and soul have become one thing, so one word was so often used to combine all three concepts. There are even the remains of this idea, manifested in our modern concept of “ghosts”, which are often depicted in the form of anthropomorphic clouds or translucent vapors. This definitely makes it clear that, despite all the sophisticated philosophical pretentiousness, the doctrine of the Holy Spirit is very literally nothing more than a shocking air.
