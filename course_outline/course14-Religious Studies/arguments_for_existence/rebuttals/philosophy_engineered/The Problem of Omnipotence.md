title: "The Problem of Omnipotence"

<div>
<p>
imagine yourself relaxing at home one day when&nbsp; you suddenly hear a knock at the front door to&nbsp;&nbsp; your amazement it appears to be none other than&nbsp; John de Lancie himself standing on your doorstep&nbsp;&nbsp; hello he says my name is Q from the Q continuum&nbsp; just stopping by to let you know that I'm an&nbsp;&nbsp; omnipotent God you should probably start bowing&nbsp; before me or else I might get really upset that's&nbsp;&nbsp; cool you think you've never met an omnipotent&nbsp; being before but hey he seems like a pretty honest&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
guy and you're probably not very keen on the&nbsp; idea of getting turned into a frog right now so&nbsp;&nbsp; naturally you take him completely at his word and&nbsp; start bowing right that second am i right no of&nbsp;&nbsp; course not you're skeptical maybe this person is&nbsp; telling you the truth or maybe this person is just&nbsp;&nbsp; some weirdo pulling your leg so you demand some&nbsp; basic empirical evidence to show that this being&nbsp;&nbsp; really is what he says he is all right he says you&nbsp; want proof you got it the next thing you know mr.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Q snaps his fingers and in a brilliant flash&nbsp; of light your car is suddenly transformed into&nbsp;&nbsp; a giant pile of squirrels it's a very impressive&nbsp; trick to be sure and maybe even enough to warrant&nbsp;&nbsp; a sincere placation of this being however we're&nbsp; all hard-nosed philosophers around here and we&nbsp;&nbsp; want to be as sure as we possibly can so let's&nbsp; put this guy to the test and see whether or not&nbsp;&nbsp; he truly deserves the title of omnipotent rather&nbsp; than say really really awesome and powerful you&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
might be forgiven for thinking that this was&nbsp; a perfectly straightforward question to ask&nbsp;&nbsp; and in any other context it probably would be but&nbsp; religious philosophy has a really funny habit of&nbsp;&nbsp; tripping all over itself whenever questions like&nbsp; this crop up because as simple and intuitive as&nbsp;&nbsp; this problem may seem most religious philosophers&nbsp; cannot for the life of themselves seem to answer&nbsp;&nbsp; it coherently it's an elegant little thought&nbsp; experiment that perfectly captures the bizarre&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
mental gymnastics of Christian apologetics as&nbsp; well as some of the foundational failings of&nbsp;&nbsp; their entire philosophical world it's also a&nbsp; really fun exercise in basic critical thinking&nbsp;&nbsp; skill that takes us over a surprisingly broad&nbsp; spectrum of interesting philosophical subjects&nbsp;&nbsp; that's why I personally find this question to&nbsp; be so strangely fascinating and why I think&nbsp;&nbsp; you'll enjoy following me down the looming rap&nbsp; whole that it represents to begin our analysis&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
let's frame the question in terms of something&nbsp; a little more mundane rather than claim to be a&nbsp;&nbsp; full-on omnipotent deity suppose instead that&nbsp; our stranger merely claims to be a reasonably&nbsp;&nbsp; competent automobile mechanic it's basically the&nbsp; exact same situation as before but now framed in a&nbsp;&nbsp; completely non religious context so ask yourself&nbsp; now how exactly should we go about verifying&nbsp;&nbsp; this claim after all it's not like we just take&nbsp; random people completely at their word for this&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
stuff there's real money at stake here plus the&nbsp; functionality of our cars surely there must be&nbsp;&nbsp; some sort of test we can offer before honoring him&nbsp; with such a title right obviously the answer is&nbsp;&nbsp; yes and it works like this go and get out a piece&nbsp; of paper and write the following words at the top&nbsp;&nbsp; things that a competent automobile mechanic should&nbsp; be able to do after that you just enumerate the&nbsp;&nbsp; list with a collection of pertinent challenges for&nbsp; example number one change a tire number two change&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
oil number three flush coolant number four and so&nbsp; on until you've completely populated the list once&nbsp;&nbsp; finished you can then issue your challenge&nbsp; in the following fashion dear mr. stranger&nbsp;&nbsp; given the proper tools workspace assistance etc&nbsp; I challenge you to complete each of these items&nbsp;&nbsp; on my list within a reasonable amount of time or&nbsp; if the list happens to be infinite in length then&nbsp;&nbsp; at least complete a reasonable sampling of items&nbsp; until I'm satisfied they're done if our subject is&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
successful then great is officially earned himself&nbsp; the title of competent automobile mechanic and if&nbsp;&nbsp; not then oh well maybe he's just pretty good with&nbsp; cars or perhaps halfway decent that's fine too&nbsp;&nbsp; they're just words and labels now to be fair this&nbsp; isn't exactly how we go about our daily lives but&nbsp;&nbsp; it does illustrate an important philosophical&nbsp; aspect over the nature of language doctors&nbsp;&nbsp; lawyers presidents squirrels rocks potatoes&nbsp; Thor all just labels that we define and assign&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
in accordance with a distinct set of empirically&nbsp; verifiable properties anything that demonstrates&nbsp;&nbsp; the properties of a given list may officially earn&nbsp; the corresponding title while things which fail to&nbsp;&nbsp; satisfy those properties are simply not referred&nbsp; to as such it's basically a form of philosophical&nbsp;&nbsp; verification ISM and it presents a foundational&nbsp; pillar on which human language operates with that&nbsp;&nbsp; in mind let's go back to our supposedly omnipotent&nbsp; friend mr. Q start by getting out a piece of paper&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
and writing the following words at the top things&nbsp; that an omnipotent being should be able to do what&nbsp;&nbsp; items go on the list now the answer it turns&nbsp; out depends a lot on who you ask for example&nbsp;&nbsp; according to one school of thought the answer&nbsp; is pretty simple anything literally anything you&nbsp;&nbsp; can think of goes on the list make it rain frogs&nbsp; check create a married bachelor you got it flarg&nbsp;&nbsp; alas nuffin sure why not this is a naive form of&nbsp; omnipotence commonly referred to as absolutism or&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
absolute omnipotence Rene Descartes was a famous&nbsp; defender of this position and even some modern&nbsp;&nbsp; philosophers have periodically defended it as well&nbsp; it's actually pretty easy to see where this idea&nbsp;&nbsp; comes from given that the Bible itself practically&nbsp; screams this interpretation at you for instance&nbsp;&nbsp; Matthew 19:26 mark 10 27 Luke 1:37 job 42 - and&nbsp; Philippians 4:13 despite its intuitive basis in&nbsp;&nbsp; Christian scripture the idea of absolutism is&nbsp; clearly riddled with problems for example take&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
the challenge of flogging a snuffin according to&nbsp; absolutism mr. Q here should be perfectly capable&nbsp;&nbsp; of doing exactly that without a second thought yet&nbsp; it should be obvious by now floral and snuffin are&nbsp;&nbsp; just gibberish words I made up out of nothing&nbsp; they have no established definition so pray tell&nbsp;&nbsp; what exactly could our subject ever do that would&nbsp; satisfy the challenge bear in mind now that this&nbsp;&nbsp; is not a limitation on our subject per se but a&nbsp; simple problem of language it's like mashing my&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
keyboard with random characters and saying here&nbsp; do this there's simply nothing to do I may as&nbsp;&nbsp; well just stand there in silence or perhaps shrug&nbsp; my shoulders and grunt mr. Q cannot ever hope to&nbsp;&nbsp; fulfill a challenge if no coherent challenge was&nbsp; actually given notice that a similar argument also&nbsp;&nbsp; applies to the challenge of creating a married&nbsp; bachelor by definition a bachelor is an unmarried&nbsp;&nbsp; man which means the creation of a married bachelor&nbsp; is the same thing as creating a married man who&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
is also not married a logical contradiction the&nbsp; set of all things that are married is mutually&nbsp;&nbsp; exclusive to the set of all things that are&nbsp; not married that therefore it doesn't matter&nbsp;&nbsp; what mr. queue ever presents to me because the&nbsp; rules of logic forbid me from ever recognizing&nbsp;&nbsp; a successful outcome again that's not a limitation&nbsp; on our subject but another limitation on language&nbsp;&nbsp; itself the very words used to formulate the&nbsp; challenge are simply put together wrongly this&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
is exactly why absolutism is generally regarded as&nbsp; a pretty terrible form of omnipotence nevertheless&nbsp;&nbsp; it is important to recognize that the death of&nbsp; absolutism does not necessarily imply the death&nbsp;&nbsp; of God all it says is that whatever things are&nbsp; out there for us to give labels to none of them&nbsp;&nbsp; will ever be able to demonstrate omnipotence to&nbsp; any rational satisfaction and since no being can&nbsp;&nbsp; ever possibly earn itself such a title even&nbsp; in principle the title itself is essentially&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
meaningless if however we simply redefine on&nbsp; evidence to mean something slightly different then&nbsp;&nbsp; all of the problems we just talked about would&nbsp; immediately vanish in a puff of logic remember&nbsp;&nbsp; now that all we're trying to do here at the end of&nbsp; the day is define a word if that word is coherent&nbsp;&nbsp; logical and verifiable then great we can use it&nbsp; to describe various entities in our environment if&nbsp;&nbsp; and when we ever happen to encounter them but if&nbsp; the word is incoherent or logically inconsistent&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
then oh well it's not like the universe cares one&nbsp; way or the other all it means is that we can't use&nbsp;&nbsp; the word to meaningfully describe stuff time to&nbsp; go back to the drawing board and see if we can't&nbsp;&nbsp; think of something better much to the credit&nbsp; of religious philosophers today that seems to&nbsp;&nbsp; be exactly what happened rather than literally&nbsp; be capable of doing anything a far more common&nbsp;&nbsp; view of omnipotence is the ability to do all&nbsp; that is logically possible it's a perfectly&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
straightforward revision that specifically seeks&nbsp; to avoid the incoherence of absolutism while still&nbsp;&nbsp; preserving the totality of power we've come to&nbsp; expect and that's a good thing so let's all get&nbsp;&nbsp; out a piece of paper and write the following words&nbsp; at the top logically possible actions what exactly&nbsp;&nbsp; does this mean how do we determine whether or not&nbsp; some particular task should go on the list here's&nbsp;&nbsp; how I interpret it consider a simple challenge&nbsp; like eita taco if i can imagine some logically&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
possible world wherein that task is being&nbsp; performed by some agent then good it goes&nbsp;&nbsp; on the list for example I can imagine a logically&nbsp; possible world where it is true that the President&nbsp;&nbsp; of the United States is eating a taco therefore&nbsp; it seems to me it must be logically possible to&nbsp;&nbsp; eat a taco it is officially something that can be&nbsp; done and therefore it must go on the list anything&nbsp;&nbsp; that wishes to call itself omnipotent must have&nbsp; therefore be able to replicate that feat that&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
was easy enough so let's shake things up a bit by&nbsp; asking a very simple question is it or is it not&nbsp;&nbsp; logically possible to tell a lie obviously the&nbsp; answer has to be yes because people around the&nbsp;&nbsp; world tell lies all the time therefore by modal&nbsp; axiom B it must be logically possible to tell a&nbsp;&nbsp; lie therefore by the definition of omnipotence&nbsp; all omnipotent beings must be able to tell lies&nbsp;&nbsp; strangely enough however the Holy Christian Bible&nbsp; says outright that lying is something God cannot&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
do not just something that God doesn't do or&nbsp; chooses not to do but literally cannot do see for&nbsp;&nbsp; example Titus 1:2 or Hebrews 6:18 so right off the&nbsp; bat the very definition offered by professional&nbsp;&nbsp; Christian philosophers themselves has immediately&nbsp; precluded their very own God from being omnipotent&nbsp;&nbsp; isn't that funny but let's ignore that little&nbsp; problem anyway and see what else we can find wrong&nbsp;&nbsp; with this definition how about this go outside&nbsp; and start collecting rocks into a giant pile keep&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
piling up rocks until the pile is so heavy that&nbsp; you cannot ever hope to lift them congratulations&nbsp;&nbsp; you have just created a finite pile of rocks&nbsp; that officially satisfies the description of&nbsp;&nbsp; being unlifted bull by its own maker therefore&nbsp; it must be logically possible to create a pile&nbsp;&nbsp; of rocks or even a single rock that satisfies the&nbsp; description of being unlifted oh by its own maker&nbsp;&nbsp; therefore all omnipotent beings must be able to&nbsp; replicate this task so let's pose the challenge&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
shall we dear mr. Q I challenge you to create a&nbsp; finite Rock such that its own maker cannot lift&nbsp;&nbsp; it go so far so good right but what happens if&nbsp; mr. Q actually succeeds in this challenge after&nbsp;&nbsp; all last time I checked it is always logically&nbsp; possible to lift a finite Rock notice how this&nbsp;&nbsp; is just a simple variation on the paradox&nbsp; of the stone can God create a rock so heavy&nbsp;&nbsp; that even God himself cannot lift it it's a famous&nbsp; philosophical challenge to the idea of omnipotence&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
because it logically prevents any being from&nbsp; ever demonstrating such a property by definition&nbsp;&nbsp; all omnipotent beings must at any given moment&nbsp; possess the power to both create rocks and to&nbsp;&nbsp; lift rocks subject to certain specifications yet&nbsp; the moment our subject creates a rock he cannot&nbsp;&nbsp; lift he cannot possibly satisfy the definition of&nbsp; omnipotence anymore that means no being can ever&nbsp;&nbsp; possibly earn the title of omnipotence because&nbsp; the very act of proving it requires them to not&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
have it notice also that we could just as easily&nbsp; frame this exact same problem any number of ways&nbsp;&nbsp; for example one of my personal favorites is to&nbsp; stand before a podium and truthfully speak the&nbsp;&nbsp; words I am NOT omnipotent again it's a perfectly&nbsp; logical task in that I can imagine a logically&nbsp;&nbsp; possible world where this is taking place&nbsp; therefore at any given moment and omnipotent&nbsp;&nbsp; being must by definition be able to replicate&nbsp; that task stand before a podium and truthfully&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
speak the words I am NOT omnipotent unfortunately&nbsp; the only way to actually possess such a power is&nbsp;&nbsp; by not being omnipotent bear in mind now that&nbsp; this is not some clever philosophical trick but&nbsp;&nbsp; a fundamental property of binary propositional&nbsp; logic self referential propositions when coupled&nbsp;&nbsp; with logical negations tend to produce really&nbsp; goofy inconsistencies it's the exact same reason&nbsp;&nbsp; why we have so many other famous paradoxes as&nbsp; well for example the liars paradox Russell's&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
paradox the halting problem and even girdle's&nbsp; incompleteness theorems are all just similar&nbsp;&nbsp; manifestations of self referential negation&nbsp; so it's not like I'm just making this stuff up&nbsp;&nbsp; because philosophers logicians and mathematicians&nbsp; have been studying this exact same phenomenon for&nbsp;&nbsp; centuries we therefore must conclude that the&nbsp; capacity to do all that as logically possible&nbsp;&nbsp; is ironically not a logical possibility you can&nbsp; either be complete or you can be consistent but&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
you cannot have both simultaneously at this point&nbsp; you would think that most Christians would simply&nbsp;&nbsp; say something like y-yes that seems to be a bit&nbsp; of an issue perhaps my conception of omnipotence&nbsp;&nbsp; is just a little bit too greedy let's maybe learn&nbsp; from the last hundred years of mathematical logic&nbsp;&nbsp; and see if we can't find something a little less&nbsp; contradictory but of course the exact opposite&nbsp;&nbsp; is generally true with haqq philosophers around&nbsp; the world dogmatically clinging to their precious&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
definition anyway for instance one complaint&nbsp; that you might hear is how the challenge itself&nbsp;&nbsp; is inherently ambiguous when I create a rock the&nbsp; word maker refers to myself the person speaking to&nbsp;&nbsp; you right now yet when someone else performs the&nbsp; same task the meaning of maker suddenly changes in&nbsp;&nbsp; other words the challenge shares the same type of&nbsp; proposition but not the same token thus in order&nbsp;&nbsp; for the challenge to be comparable mr. Q would not&nbsp; need to create a rock that he cannot lift but only&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
create a rock that I cannot lift this may sound&nbsp; like a somewhat reasonable point at first but&nbsp;&nbsp; quickly falls apart the moment you actually stop&nbsp; and think about it for starters we don't have to&nbsp;&nbsp; use the word maker if we don't want to we could&nbsp; have challenged our subject to create a rock so&nbsp;&nbsp; heavy that no being in the universe could lift it&nbsp; or better yet stand before a podium in truthfully&nbsp;&nbsp; state the proposition that there are no omnipotent&nbsp; beings there's still logically possible actions in&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
some logically possible world which means they&nbsp; still have to go on the list the real problem&nbsp;&nbsp; however is that all actions are inherently self&nbsp; referential 2cy simply imagine what would happen&nbsp;&nbsp; if I challenged you right now to eat a taco&nbsp; naturally if you're like most people the obvious&nbsp;&nbsp; interpretation of that task is to immediately&nbsp; grab a taco and start shoving it into your face&nbsp;&nbsp; if however you were to then challenged me to&nbsp; replicate that task what exactly do you imagine&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
happening next do I begin shoving a taco into my&nbsp; own face or must I literally shove a second taco&nbsp;&nbsp; into your face and force you to eat it obviously&nbsp; the former interpretation is the correct viewpoint&nbsp;&nbsp; because that's how every english-speaking human&nbsp; on the planet understands it the only point of&nbsp;&nbsp; issuing a challenge like this in the first place&nbsp; is to see if you have the power within yourself&nbsp;&nbsp; to replicate a power that I had within myself yet&nbsp; for some strange reason the moment we try to apply&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
this same line of Reason within a religious&nbsp; philosophical context then all of a sudden&nbsp;&nbsp; people start acting like a bunch of pedantic&nbsp; morons by invoking the type token distinction&nbsp;&nbsp; in this way it is literally meaningless for me to&nbsp; challenge you to eat a taco I have to instead say&nbsp;&nbsp; something horribly obtuse like I challenge you&nbsp; to bring about the event of you eating this taco&nbsp;&nbsp; well I'm sorry guys but events are not the same&nbsp; thing as actions and I should not have to specify&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
a particular act or in order to coherently define&nbsp; some particular act when you challenge me to jump&nbsp;&nbsp; five feet in the air you obviously mean that I&nbsp; have to propel myself with my own legs off the&nbsp;&nbsp; ground beneath me if however I then challenge&nbsp; you to jump five feet in the air then obviously&nbsp;&nbsp; you must now propel yourself off the ground with&nbsp; your legs all logically possible actions are in&nbsp;&nbsp; some way or another inherently self referential&nbsp; deal with it with that taken care of the next&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
most common objection I tend to hear is that&nbsp; omnipotence doesn't really mean the ability to&nbsp;&nbsp; do all that is logically possible rather it&nbsp; means something more like the ability to do&nbsp;&nbsp; all that is consistent with one's nature that&nbsp; is to say if the proposition Y is doing X is&nbsp;&nbsp; logically self consistent then for an omnipotent&nbsp; being it will always be true that Y can do X ok&nbsp;&nbsp; fair enough if you want to just summarily change&nbsp; the definition of omnipotence again then that's&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
great it was a bad definition from the beginning&nbsp; and we can only grow as philosophers by trying&nbsp;&nbsp; to find something better but can we please all be&nbsp; grown-up enough to admit that this is nothing more&nbsp;&nbsp; than an indirect admission of defeat the previous&nbsp; definition was inherently flawed and so now we're&nbsp;&nbsp; changing it into something else yet whenever&nbsp; I talk to Christian apologists about this they&nbsp;&nbsp; almost always pretend as if the new definition&nbsp; is really what it was supposed to be all along&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
and how dare I strawman such brilliant thinkers&nbsp; by ever suggesting otherwise fine whatever let's&nbsp;&nbsp; just roll with it and see what we can find this&nbsp; time shot we can an omnipotent being tell a lie&nbsp;&nbsp; or what typically the answer to this question&nbsp; is that it depends on the being for example the&nbsp;&nbsp; god of Christianity cannot tell a lie because&nbsp; doing so would contradict his perfectly honest&nbsp;&nbsp; nature thus to ask God to tell a lie is the&nbsp; logical equivalent to asking a perfectly honest&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
being - not to be perfectly honest apparently a&nbsp; logical contradiction but don't worry God still&nbsp;&nbsp; gets to be omnipotent anyway because he can still&nbsp; do all the things that are consistent with his&nbsp;&nbsp; divine unchanging nature likewise God cannot stand&nbsp; before a podium and shout I am NOT omnipotent&nbsp;&nbsp; because that would produce a contradiction as&nbsp; well omnipotence is an inherent part of God's&nbsp;&nbsp; nature so therefore it doesn't have to go on a&nbsp; list of things that God can do BAM problem solved&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
this is usually the part where I begin to lose&nbsp; all patience with religious philosophers because&nbsp;&nbsp; responses like this are clearly not well thought&nbsp; out it really gets under my skin too because it&nbsp;&nbsp; represents a profound laziness that makes no&nbsp; effort whatsoever to consider the practical&nbsp;&nbsp; implications of what is actually being said to&nbsp; illustrate simply imagine God himself standing&nbsp;&nbsp; on my doorstep in all his glory when I issued the&nbsp; following challenge dear God I challenge you right&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
now to tell me a lie tell me that you're a potato&nbsp; go pray tell what exactly do Christians imagine&nbsp;&nbsp; happening next because as far as I can tell they&nbsp; seem to imagine something like that scene from&nbsp;&nbsp; liar liar where Jim Carrey tries to say that the&nbsp; pen is red but just can't bring himself to do it&nbsp;&nbsp; as if some invisible metaphysical force of honesty&nbsp; is somehow preventing the words from coming out of&nbsp;&nbsp; his mouth call me crazy but I hardly find that&nbsp; to be consistent with the idea of unlimited&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
potentiality or maybe Christians just imagined God&nbsp; standing there with a dumb look on his face as if&nbsp;&nbsp; he didn't even understand the question or what&nbsp; if he just says I'm sorry but that would violate&nbsp;&nbsp; my essential nature no thanks what in the hell&nbsp; am I supposed to do with that but let's take it&nbsp;&nbsp; one step further suppose you challenge me to lift&nbsp; a thousand pound car over my head oh except that&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sorry that would violate my essential nature&nbsp; you see I'm a beam comprised physical muscle mass&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
that can only lift 200 pounds when you ask me&nbsp; to lift a thousand pounds you're asking me to&nbsp;&nbsp; perform a contradiction a being that cannot lift&nbsp; more than 200 pounds is lifting more than 200&nbsp;&nbsp; pounds not only that but any challenge you give&nbsp; me can be counteracted in the exact same way no&nbsp;&nbsp; being can logically be expected to do the things&nbsp; it cannot do so congratulations my dear Christians&nbsp;&nbsp; you've solved the omnipotence paradox all you&nbsp; had to do was replace it with the omnipotence&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
tautology literally anything and everything in&nbsp; the universe is now omnipotent because nothing&nbsp;&nbsp; can ever logically do the things it cannot do&nbsp; aha I hear you saying it is only incidental&nbsp;&nbsp; that you cannot lift a thousand pounds I can still&nbsp; imagine a possible world wherein you are lifting&nbsp;&nbsp; a thousand pounds over your head therefore it&nbsp; may be logically possible but not physically&nbsp;&nbsp; possible actually no what you're imagining right&nbsp; now isn't me it may be an entity very similar to&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
me but that's not really me because as we just&nbsp; established I am NOT a being who can lift a&nbsp;&nbsp; thousand pounds over my head or better yet let's&nbsp; just play that same game in Reverse I can imagine&nbsp;&nbsp; a possible world wherein God is telling a lie&nbsp; now what what's the difference why is lying a&nbsp;&nbsp; violation of God's essential nature but lifting&nbsp; a thousand pounds is totally consistent with mine&nbsp;&nbsp; because as far as I can tell this entire line&nbsp; of reasoning appears to be nothing more than&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
blatant special pleading when God can't do a thing&nbsp; then it must be because it violates his essential&nbsp;&nbsp; nature yet when I can't do a thing and apparently&nbsp; it's little more than a conditional happenstance&nbsp;&nbsp; of my feeble limited existence so once again we&nbsp; have another example of responding to an argument&nbsp;&nbsp; without any effort to actually address the&nbsp; argument but the thing I find absolutely hilarious&nbsp;&nbsp; about this new definition is how of all people&nbsp; the famous apologist Alvin Plantinga himself&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
personally debunked it as far back as the 1960s&nbsp; all you have to do is imagine a man called mr.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mick ear who just so happens to have one essential&nbsp; property he has only the power to scratch his ear&nbsp;&nbsp; and nothing else thus by definition any other&nbsp; task you challenge him to complete as a logical&nbsp;&nbsp; violation of his essential nature hardly an&nbsp; all-powerful being wouldn't you say yet according&nbsp;&nbsp; to our new definition mr. McKee ear is still just&nbsp; as omnipotent as Almighty God himself all tangents&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
aside the real problem with this whole essential&nbsp; nature business is just that essentialism the&nbsp;&nbsp; idea that there exists some kind of intrinsic&nbsp; essence to things which makes them what they are&nbsp;&nbsp; it's a perfectly natural bias through which human&nbsp; beings tend to look at the world but it's still&nbsp;&nbsp; completely bogus ever since the Greek philosopher&nbsp; Plutarch introduced the Theseus paradox back in&nbsp;&nbsp; the 1st century philosophers have had very good&nbsp; reasons to reject essentialism as a worthless&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
incoherent concept a chair does not have some&nbsp; magically objective essence of chair ness that&nbsp;&nbsp; makes it a chair it's just some arrangement of&nbsp; physical material stuff that human beings have&nbsp;&nbsp; arbitrarily decided to sit on and call a chair&nbsp; likewise there is no such thing as essence of&nbsp;&nbsp; godliness that would make God God rather there&nbsp; is only a distinct collection of empirically&nbsp;&nbsp; verifiable properties which if demonstrated would&nbsp; earn some lucky entity the official title of God&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
so not only do we have Christians pushing yet&nbsp; another idea of omnipotence that just doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp; work but it's grounded on philosophical&nbsp; presumptions that have been categorically&nbsp;&nbsp; debunked for almost 2,000 years however it really&nbsp; needs to be emphasized that all of these crazy&nbsp;&nbsp; problems would vanish in a heartbeat if only&nbsp; the Christians would just stop insisting on such&nbsp;&nbsp; bungled definitions it's sad too because it's&nbsp; really not that hard to come up with something&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

relatively functional so let's do the theists job&nbsp; for them and just define omnipotence in a way that&nbsp;&nbsp; isn't stupid shall we omnipotence the capacity to&nbsp; create destroy and rearrange matter and energy in&nbsp;&nbsp; accordance with arbitrary whims they're done if we&nbsp; ever encounter any being with this kind of power I&nbsp;&nbsp; will be more than happy to refer to such a being&nbsp; as omnipotent and he create rocks sure can he&nbsp;&nbsp; lift rocks absolutely but can he create a rock so&nbsp; heavy that even its own maker cannot lift it nope&nbsp;&nbsp;

not a chance but guess what that's perfectly okay&nbsp; because still logically consistent with the stated&nbsp;&nbsp; definition notice how a definition like this also&nbsp; solves all kinds of goofy philosophical issues for&nbsp;&nbsp; example one lesser-known problem with omnipotence&nbsp; is the problem of creating two omnipotent beings&nbsp;&nbsp; at once so let's imagine a possible world wearing&nbsp; two beings are both competing for the official&nbsp;&nbsp; title of omnipotent deity all we have to do is&nbsp; make a game out of it challenge one guy to turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

my car into a pile of squirrels while challenging&nbsp; the other guy to turn it into a sack of potatoes&nbsp;&nbsp; whichever outcome occurs will then determine which&nbsp; guy is the loser and which guy earns the title&nbsp;&nbsp; done or better yet let's consider another lesser&nbsp; known problem I challenge you to truthfully tell&nbsp;&nbsp; me what I ate for dinner last year you'll notice&nbsp; that this is not really so much a test of power&nbsp;&nbsp; but rather a test of knowledge yet according to&nbsp; most classical definitions for omnipotence there&nbsp;&nbsp;

is no distinction the omnipotent being must be&nbsp; able to do it because I formulated the challenge&nbsp;&nbsp; as a logically coherent action if however we adopt&nbsp; the new definition then it is now possible for a&nbsp;&nbsp; being to be omnipotent but not necessarily&nbsp; omniscient all-powerful and all-knowing are&nbsp;&nbsp; now philosophically distinct concepts as we&nbsp; should reasonably expect them to be notice&nbsp;&nbsp; also of how there are still many possible ways to&nbsp; potentially break the definition for example could&nbsp;&nbsp;

an omnipotent being create another omnipotent&nbsp; being or what if I challenge the being to kill&nbsp;&nbsp; itself would that violate the definition maybe&nbsp; maybe not but you'll notice I'm not racking my&nbsp;&nbsp; brain with obtuse rationalizations just to protect&nbsp; a stupid definition if it works then great and if&nbsp;&nbsp; not then oh well we'll just think of something&nbsp; better later the ultimate irony in this entire&nbsp;&nbsp; discussion is that when all is said and done I'm&nbsp; basically just fixing the theists philosophical&nbsp;&nbsp;

problems for them yet if past experience is any&nbsp; guide the overwhelming majority of them will never&nbsp;&nbsp; see it that way instead they'll probably view&nbsp; this entire discussion as a literal attack on&nbsp;&nbsp; God himself as if the words used to describe some&nbsp; possible entity might have real power over whether&nbsp;&nbsp; or not it actually exists that's what happens&nbsp; when you live your life defending Dogma rather&nbsp;&nbsp; than honestly searching for a better understand of&nbsp; the world but the thing I find really embarrassing&nbsp;&nbsp;
