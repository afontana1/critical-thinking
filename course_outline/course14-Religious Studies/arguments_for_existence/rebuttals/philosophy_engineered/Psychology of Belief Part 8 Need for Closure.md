<p>
Psychology of beliefs, part 8: the need for completeness - Well, I'm not absolutely sure that Jesus is a god, but I better go for Jesus than you guys. Because you guys cannot tell me where everything came from, you do not know. - We are working on it. - Well, when you find out, then maybe I will listen. -Why is there something instead of nothing? - Creation is one hundred percent scientific evidence of the existence of the Creator!You cannot have a creation without a creator. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Well, where did everything come from?Why is there something instead of nothing?How did life appear? All these questions are very important, and answers can give us a deep understanding of the nature of the cosmos. Unfortunately, our modern scientific understanding is still in ignorance of the details of the origin of life, the universe and much more. But despite this fact, the crowds of believers still feel their final righteousness when they speak with absolute confidence about the deepest secrets of being. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The situation is even more aggravated by shameful rational justifications that are usually used in these statements. Observation: I have no idea how something is as large and complicated as the Universe appeared. Conclusion: some kind of great and powerful deity should have magically conjure all this with a conscious intention and to do all this specifically with the calculation of people. A particularly regrettable feature of this argument is how ridiculous it is simply to expose it. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, if the universe is too mysterious and complex to arise for natural reasons, then how do we solve this problem, arbitrarily postulating the existence of something even more mysterious and even more difficult? Or even better, how can we generally conclude that there was only one creator, and not 7, 10 or a billion? And if complex things cannot exist without the need for targeted creators, then who created the Creator? - Just because you do not know absolutely everything, this does not mean that you can fill in the gaps with any fairy tale that you will like! 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, it is obvious that such arguments are nothing more as the classical reasoning of the "god of gaps" - When we are faced with a fundamental gap in our understanding, there is a very strong tendency to fill the void with unprepared postulations. But despite such logical inadequacy, millions of believers are still sincerely convinced by such arguments. Therefore, such behavior is a much more mundane riddle that deserves an honest study. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Namely: why so many people are convinced of such an obviously lame logic? Consider the following experiment. Meet Bob.Despite the fact that you do not know anything about him, I want you to appreciate the personal qualities of Bob on a 8-point scale. To help you with Bob evaluate, I interviewed six of his random acquaintances and received six adjectives describing him. Ready?These words: smart, artistic, sentimental, cool, strange, picky. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It's simple, right?Some words are obviously favorable, and some are not. Therefore, it is not surprising to find that people on average evaluate the favors of Bob at 1.38. Now let's change the conditions a little. Meet Karl.Again, I want you to appreciate the favorable personality of Karl, on the basis of six adjectives.Ready?Here is your new set of words: Picky, strange, cool, sentimental, artistic, smart. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
As we can see, this is absolutely the same set of words, but in the reverse order. And remember that, as far as you know, these words were chosen by accident from people who were familiar with Karl. Therefore, the information is absolutely the same, and we should expect to come to the same average indicator for the favorable Karl, right? Wrong!In reality, the words on our list were not at all accidental, but served as a smooth transition from favorable to adverse personal qualities. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In the case of Bob, positive adjectives were provided at the beginning, and gradually turned into negative ones. In the case of Karl, at first there were negative adjectives, followed by positive ones. Thus, even though the information was exactly the same in both cases, it turns out that the procedure for providing information has a significant impact on our final impressions. When negative words are provided to positive, subjects tend to respond almost more negatively when evaluating the favorableness of Karl. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The difference between these two results is the "effect of the primacy" - When people try to make their judgments under ambiguous conditions, the natural tendency will be to experience a stronger influence from the information that came earlier, and not later. Now, holding this information in your head, we will consider another experiment. Suppose you are a hired leader in a large company. Your task is to assess the potential success or failure of the new president of the company, Phil. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
To help you in your assessment, you are given a record of the behavior of Phil in various business circumstances. However, outside your knowledge, the records were deliberately fused so as to provide you with a positive experience, and then negative. In parallel with this, another group of subjects receives negative information, and then positive. Further, suppose that I then tell you that this study is still in the experimental stage, and we are not at all sure how justified your results will turn out. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Moreover, in accordance with professional ethics, we cannot tell you how Phil really can cope with his work, and you will never see how good the prediction you have made. In other words, you can make any prediction at will, and you will not be responsible to anyone. With such free expectations from the experiment, the subjects naturally have a slight motivation for the objective assessment of all data and the preparation of the correct judgment. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, it is not surprising when we find a high degree of primacy effect. Now let's change the conditions a little. To motivate you to draw up a correct assessment, you were now told that this study is very important for companies around the world, and you are expected to justify your answers to a large group. Moreover, your results will be publicly compared with the real labor successes of Phil, and everyone will see how really you are really smart in the prediction of labor indicators. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This contributes to a high degree of so -called "awareness of assessment." This means that now you have a strong motivation to explore all evidence and make a reasonable prediction. Of course, such conditions will lower the tendency to the effect of championship, right? Well, in reality, yes!When the awareness of the assessment is high, the subjects really considered evidence more balanced. Now, let's change the conditions again. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Suppose I set a three -minute period for your possibility of preparing an answer. Moreover, in order to remind you of a hurry, there will even be a man with a clock next to you, ready to pick up your result after time. That is, although you have a high awareness of assessment, but we still add the pressure of time to this. Therefore, you have a strong motivation to give the first answer that came to mind, instead of relaxing and reflecting on evidence. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Of course, the addition of a temporary framework will block your awareness of assessment and increase your tendency to the effect of the championship, right? Again, yes!When the subjects are subjected to combination of time pressure and assessment awareness, the pressure of time wins and the effect of championship increases. The reason for this is that the pressure of time generates the psychological sense of the so -called "need for cognitive completeness." In other words, the subjects need to answer very quickly, and any answer is more preferable than misunderstanding and ambiguity. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
As a result, the natural result of this is the behavior known as the “cognitive closeness” - This means that the subjects are simply clinging to the first information that fall, and then ignore any subsequent information. Thus, the effect of championship is not only a frequent and reproducible phenomenon, but its effects can be aggravated by changing surrounding factors. The pressure of time, mental fatigue, and even a noisy environment can increase the tendency to the effect of championship in the formation of judgments in conditions of uncertainty. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
So, how is all this connected with the "god of gaps"? It turns out that the effect of the championship is so tangible and distinct that it can even be measured as the internal quality of the human personality. Don't believe me?Then consider the following experiment. Suppose again that you are a hired leader in a large company, only this time you were tested on the scale of your "need for cognitive completeness." Such tests are ordinary questionnaires for self -esteem, and they measure in a person the desire for specific answers, as opposed to the unknown and ambiguity. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
People who have high rates are classified as having a high need for completeness, and people who have low indicators - a low need for completeness. As in the previous experiment, your task is to assess the potential labor success of the new president of the company, Phil. To help you make your final judgment, you are provided with records of his labor process in various business circumstances. Of course, without your knowledge, the records were specially faded to provide information from positive to negative or from negative to positive. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
So, if you are such a person who likes to evaluate all the facts before making any judgment, then you must theoretically receive low points on the scale of need for completeness. Nevertheless, the effect of the championship is already clearly established as the ubiquitous property of human nature. Of course, some points on some stupid psychological test will never be able to lead to measurable predictions in human behavior, or will they be able to? Absolutely can!People who showed low points on the scale of the need for completeness were practically immune to the effect of the primacy. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It doesn’t matter in what order the information was submitted to them, subjects with low points really gave almost the same assessments of the potential success of Phil. So, if the subjects with a low need for completeness provided equal results, does this really mean that the effect of the championship is more pronounced in those who showed high points on the scale of need for completeness? And again, yes!In subjects with a high need for cognitive completeness, the effect of the championship is pronounced. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Such people are sincerely inclined to evaluate the world on the only basis for which information was received first. Thus, when people are sincerely convinced by empty arguments from ignorance or the frank logic of the god of gaps, what exactly is happening? This is how it works.People with a high need for cognitive completeness also have a strong predisposition to the effect of championship. This means that in any situation, including uncertainty, misunderstanding or ambiguity, Whatever the answer comes first to fill the gap, will be willingly picked up without special fluctuations. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
When the answer is established, the subject experiences cognitive closeness on this issue, serene ignoring all subsequent information, even if it conflicts with the initial conclusion. That is why the arguments of the god of gaps are so convincing for such a large number of people. “God has done this” is such a frequent answer to such many questions that people with a high need for completeness cannot do anything but to cling to him when they are faced with deep uncertainty. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
If people were just honest about these matters, answering them with a firm statement that “no one knows that” Then even this answer can potentially be sufficient to satisfy the need for cognitive completeness. - I can live with doubts and uncertainty and ignorance. I think that it is much more interesting to live without knowing how to have answers that can be erroneous. So, in the end, given all this information, how can we overcome the natural human tendency to argue from ignorance? Firstly, we must understand that, despite the logical absurdity of the god of gaps, it is still a perfectly convincing argument for those who have a high need for completeness. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Secondly, when questions are asked about the origin of life, the universe and everything, then amorphous reasoning will not help. While we will not be able to provide clear and detailed answers to these questions, we must learn to feel comfortable with the concept “I don't know”. She is clear, she is honest, and she satisfies the need for completeness, which many of us possess. Finally, the “awareness of assessment” is a proven tool to lower the effect of the championship caused by the need for completion. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This means that this is extremely important that we demand from each other responsibility for the thinking that we use to come to our beliefs, And they motivated each other to explore all available evidence before coming to the conclusion. Therefore, we must emphasize the importance of finding truth with bona fide academic discipline and intellectual honesty. Otherwise, we can fall into excessive confidence in our erroneous conclusions based on unreliable assumptions.

- These so -called “arguments” are similar to something similar: I do not see anything on the surface of Venus at all. Why not?Because it is covered with a thick layer of clouds. And what are clouds?Water, of course.Then there should be a lot of water on Venus. So the surface should be wet.Well, if it is wet, then there should be a swamp, and if there is a swamp, then there should be vegetation, and if there is vegetation, then there may even be dinosaurs! Observation: nothing is visible.Conclusion: dinosaurs.
