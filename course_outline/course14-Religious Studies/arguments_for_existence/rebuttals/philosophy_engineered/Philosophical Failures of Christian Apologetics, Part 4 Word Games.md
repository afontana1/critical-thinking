I love Startrek and everything connected with it.Especially the tribbles. In general, I love tribbles so much that I want them to be real. Moreover, I know that the tribblars are real, and I can prove it. Prerequisite 1: Tribble is small, hairy mammals, usually spherical. PROPRAME 2: Tribbles are born pregnant. Prerequisite 3: Tribbles aggressively react in the presence of clingones. PROPRAME 4: If the tribblars did not exist, then they could not aggressively react in the presence of the Clingons. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, tribblars exist, right?In the end, how can tribbls hate clinings if the tribblars do not exist somewhere in the real world to hate them? The logic is impeccable and undeniable!Well, where then, damn it, my tribbble? Obviously, there is a problem.And it consists in the fact that you cannot just walk and “determine” things into reality. Because when I argue that the tribblars hate the clinings, I actually do not claim that physical tribblars physically hate physical clingons in a real, physical world. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In fact, I say that if I ever encounter a small hairy mammal with “incorrigible” properties to be born pregnant and react violently to the clingons, then this creature can be called "tribel." The definition truth is not the same as descriptive truth, and it is necessary to apply different rules for justification in each of these categories. Remember that I am free to determine the properties of the tribbles in any way as I like, and these definitions are 100%true, simply because "I said so." But at the moment when I try to say that something “exists”, I move to the descriptive statement of reality, where the epistemological rules are now completely different. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
So while philosophers may argue constantly about what exactly all these rules are, at least some of the rules are fairly well established. Good descriptive statements should be agreed, consistent and inductive; good descriptive statements must have the ability to explain a specific phenomenon simply and effectively; And good descriptive statements should allow me to make some physical choice in the real world, which leads to the desired result. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We can logically "deduce" tribbles all day long, but absolutely none of it matters until I physically hold one in my hands. And this leads us to the next philosophical failure of Christian apologetics: The idea that you can somehow “prove” synthetic judgments, just sitting in a chair and very hard to think about them. Somewhere in the depths, Christian apologists should understand that there is no real evidence for their “spiritual” statements, but psychologically these people are programmed to never admit this openly under any circumstances. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, instead, they have to resort to confusing verbal games designed to rationalize their beliefs in the face of the obvious absence of something tangible. And nothing demonstrates it better than an ontological argument in favor of the existence of God, which usually sounds something like this: “We can summarize this argument as follows. Premise 1: It is possible that a maximally great being, also known as God, exists. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
2: If the existence of the greatest creature is possible, then the most great creature exists in some possible world. 3: If the most great creature exists in some possible world, then it exists in all possible worlds. 4: If a maximally great being exists in all possible worlds, then it exists in the actual world. 5: Therefore, a maximally great being exists in the actual world. 6: Therefore, a maximally great being exists. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
7: Therefore God exists. If this argument sounds like nothing more than a bunch of confusing nonsense to you, you're absolutely right. It is as if Christians are deliberately trying to hide their obvious empirical inadequacy under a cloak of long-winded rhetorical jargon. Sometimes Christians even try to formalize it in accordance with the rules of modal logic, as if it is somehow magically added to him legitimacy. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But no matter how this argument is presented, it is easy to see that the whole thing is nothing more than a desperate attempt to imply God with words, instead of demonstrating God with evidence. Just look at the very first premise and ask yourself: What is a “maximally great being” anyway? Because, as far as I know, “greatness” is not some inherent physical parameter of things that we can objectively verify. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But ignoring this, Christians usually simply take this to mean that God is the "greatest conceivable" of all possible beings - that God, by definition, is the coolest, most amazing, awesome entity that you can imagine; the greatest possible being. But if I asked you what the “greatest conceivable integer” is, how would you even answer that? Because the moment you think you've found the right candidate, I can immediately do better by simply taking your number and adding one. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That's why every time you think you've figured out all the properties of the greatest imaginable being, all I have to do is add the condition that "plus my creature can beat yours" and I immediately found something more "greater". Thus, it is obvious that the very idea of ​​the “greatest imaginable something” is completely inconsistent and inapplicable in the first place. But that doesn't matter, because the only real point in all this "maximally great" talk is to try to push through the claim that "existence is greater than non-existence" 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
as if the mere quality of being incredibly cool automatically implies a physical presence in the real world. Of course, Christians don't say it that way, but instead dress it up in a fancy technical term called "Necessary Existence." - literally, that the very idea of ​​God contains the requirement that he must exist. So instead of wasting time parsing through a bunch of meaningless premises, all we really need to do is rewrite the argument to its core: Premise 1: God necessarily exists. 2: Therefore God exists. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That's really what it all comes down to. God, by definition, is the greatest possible being, and maximum greatness is inextricably determined by the property of necessary existence. This is an exemplary example of the classic logical fallacy called "vicious circle" or accepting a conclusion in advance, or having a conclusion among the premises, but guys with actual PhDs in philosophy invariably refuse to notice this to this day. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Remember, this has to be one of the greatest, earth shattering arguments for God that the Christian "intellectual elite" has ever come up with, but it hardly takes three minutes to show how completely ridiculous it all is. But it also shows the deliberate play on words that Christians will use to “argue” for what they cannot demonstrate. Sometimes they even try to use the “laws of logic” themselves as evidence of the existence of God, as in a transcendental argument about the existence of God. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But notice how we again have an overblown philosophical play on words designed to imply God sitting in a chair. Only this time the argument flirts heavily with a philosophical concept known as "Platonic Realism." - The idea that conceptual tools, such as logic and mathematics, must necessarily have a certain “integral existence” in themselves, regardless of space and time. It's an old idea with some appeal, but it's still completely wrong in every way. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
For example, consider such a simple mathematical concept as the “Symmetrical Law of Equality”: If a = b, then b = a.Pretty simple, right?How can this be anything other than “absolute truth”? This seems to represent some fundamental, transcendental property of the Universe itself, doesn't it? But in reality this is absolutely not the case. When you really understand the point, the symmetrical law of equality is nothing more than an axiomatic statement - a rule we have established for manipulating mathematical symbols, based on the definition of equality. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And all this particular rule says is that the truth of an equality does not depend on the order in which it is expressed. Even more humiliating for Christians is the fact that this is not some deep philosophical mystery. Any decent textbook on elementary mathematics will immediately introduce you to the fundamental axioms of algebra. - rules created by the human mind for the specific purpose of consistently manipulating mathematical expressions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That is why we say that mathematics are “invented”, and not “open”. The only real “discovery” that happens in mathematics is the strict application of rules leading to conclusions that correspond to them. Mathematical theories are really “justified” only as long as they avoid contradictions. If they are useful for describing real physical systems, then the better but Christian philosophers do try to argue that "mathematical entities" such as numbers and circles have a "genuinely transcendent existence" in their own right. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It is important to understand that the entire field of deductive logic is no different from this. Whatever we declare to be “true” by logical deduction is true only by the standard of conformity to the axioms. For example, consider the linguistic structure of a typical syllogism: PROPRAME 1: Vorf - Clingon.PROPRAME 2: All tribblars hate clingones.Therefore, all the tribblars hate Vorf. This is an absolutely justified logical conclusion that follows quite naturally from the premises. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Well, so what?All that we have done has determined a certain arbitrary set of the only property to be marked as “clingons”, and then identified Worf as a random element in this set. We then defined another arbitrary set by the property of being "things that tribbles hate" and then included Klingons as a subset within. The conclusion then follows immediately and logically, through the application of a very simple axiom from elementary set theory: If a is the subset B, and B is the subset C, then A is the subset C. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Voila! All tribbles hate Worf, despite the significant obstacle that they all don't exist in the real world. It's just a game designed to replace real words with basic patterns. Thus, while countless "specially gifted" philosophers like to remind us that logical and mathematical truths are "pure and absolute", you'll be hard pressed to find a single apologist who has any idea what logic really is or where mathematics actually comes from. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The only reason they make this argument at all is because it sets the stage for claiming certain knowledge about things that exist outside of our sensory experience of the natural world. Well, you know, for example God. They generally refuse to understand that chess and poker are created in exactly the same way as algebra and geometry: you make up the rules and see what happens! No one in their right mind would ever seriously claim that checkmate or a full house actually “exist” outside of space and time, 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
but that is precisely what Christians do when they argue for the same for logic and mathematics. The most important principle of Platonic realism is that it is a dead, useless idea, and this has been known for decades. Remember that when we assert that such a thing as "God" exists, we are making a synthetic proposition. This means that the only way to measure its truth value is to make a prediction for some particular sensory experience. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, the claim that God exists, without any possibility of empirical manifestation, is ultimately just a meaningless set of sounds. How can we know that it exists if we even in principle cannot find it? How can we confirm its properties?What would change physically if there really were two gods instead of one? How the hell do we objectively distinguish true physical reality from the unbridled fantasies of a bunch of deranged fanatics? Because a God that can only be inferred through argumentation rather than demonstrated through sensory experience is functionally equivalent to no God at all.
