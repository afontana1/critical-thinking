title: "Philosophical Failures of Christian Apologetics, Part 5 Cosmological Closure"
---
<br>

<div>
<p>
To date, one of the most common tactics of religious apologetics is To point out some deep gap in human knowledge only in order to squeeze God as an ideal explanation. And of all the gaps in our scientific understanding of the Universe, nothing is affected as often as the origin of the Universe itself. This, of course, is a recognized secret with an entire army of very smart people working on it at this very moment, But Christians are more than glad to break into and pretend that they have answers to everything. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The arguments like this are called “cosmological arguments”, and the most popular today is the famous cosmological argument “Kalam”, which usually sounds like this: “We can generalize this argument as follows: 1. That which begins to exist has a cause. 2. The Universe began to exist. 3. Therefore, the Universe has a reason. And, of course, God is the best explanation of this reason, therefore God must exist. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
While the world is full of critics who love to break this argument into pieces, they almost always lose sight of the overall picture. Remember that ultimately Christian apologists are trying to prove the existence of the Abrahamic god of the Bible. This means an omnipotent and deeply personal space agent, having great personal interest in human affairs; a being that, according to Christians themselves, has unambiguously revealed itself many times throughout history through personal manifestations and the suspension of the laws of physics on an almost global scale. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
We are talking about the creature that we desperately want us to build a deep personal relationship with him so that we can be saved from eternal torment. In principle, it should be as simple as to prove the existence of the moon, where you need to do all that you need to look at the window on the appropriate night. However, one of the most popular arguments in favor of the existence of God is nothing more than a dubious conclusion based on useless metaphysical constructions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The very nature of this argument is fundamentally simply hopeless. But what is most interesting in this argument is the method by which apologists usually set out their arguments. To this day, one repeating picture from almost every presentation of this argument is a long, tightened tirade On the secrets of the cosmology of a large explosion, the metaphysics of causality and constant reminders that our universe has a certain, final age. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And since universes don't just appear without any reason, there must have been a reason for this event that science doesn't understand. This is strange, because it is not even some kind of controversial statement, but Christians will still spend many hours discussing this issue. None of this brings us closer to justification for God, but it works perfectly as a method to stimulate human "need for cognitive completeness." It is important to understand that many people are psychologically uncomfortable from the prospects of unknown and uncertainty in their beliefs. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is a well -known cognitive distortion, which usually manifests itself as a strong predisposition to the "effect of primacy" “This means that any solid and momentary answers will be much more preferable than the thought“ I do not know ”. Moreover, human psychology also has an all -pervasive prejudice for “spontaneous social attribution”, Which means that people naturally gravitate to answers related to the deliberate actions of motivated agents. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, it is absolutely clear why apologists are constantly repeating about the secrets of the cosmology of the Big Bang, because psychologically it works in their favor. There is simply no need to bother with an effective, consistent theory, when all you need to do is to stimulate the existing prejudice from the audience. Thus, without even considering a single prerequisite seriously, the cosmological argument of the Kalam is already on a hopelessly unsteady soil. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
He uses sophisticated argument to prove what should be completely obvious, in principle, And then presses on very specific psychological buttons to artificially inflate his attractiveness. In any case, the only real goal of criticism of the premises themselves is to see how much Christians can fail even in one argument, Anyway, pretending to have an idea of how rational thinking looks. For example, what do you think about when you hear the phrase: “It begins to exist”? Because if you look like most people, you probably think about something like a carpenter when he creates a table made of wood and nails. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The table undoubtedly has a certain beginning of its existence, and it is absolutely right to say that this existence has a cause. However, if we really want to understand deeply and technically, then the carpenter actually did not “create” anything, but only “reorganized”. The table “began to exist” only when people suddenly suddenly decided to stick a linguistic shortcut on an arbitrarily ordered matter. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In fact, this same description is just as true for everything in the entire known universe. Everything that ever “began to exist” in human experience did this only through the physical reorganization of the previously existing material. And, as far as we can judge, things that “begin to exist” in a similar way do not require the intervention of any magical, incorporeal super-fuel. This difference is important, because in the context of Kalam the concept of “begins to exist” literally implies completely ready -made systems of matter and energy, simply appearing from pure, absolute non -existence 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
- A phenomenon, I remind you, who has absolutely no precedent in all human understanding! Therefore, although it may seem intuitive to assume that such an event could have a certain cause-and-effect relationship, we're still trying to draw conclusions about things that simply aren't happening. It's like trying to argue that all unicorns should have wool. It doesn't matter how sophisticated your logic may be if you forget the fact that no one has ever actually observed a physical unicorn. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
So, if apologists seriously want to protect this argument, then the first task is to create a full list of things that really “began to exist” in accordance with their definition. Thus, we can at least make a distinction, and then we can already consider the events of the real world, and then derive any potential causal relationships. But the obvious fact is that they do not have such a list. And where does he get from?The very idea itself is hardly sane at all. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
How does a thing that exists causally influence "nothing" to make "something" happen? And yet, when apologists are pressed on this very issue, they simply dismiss all objections as if you are some kind of idiot for simply pointing it out. For example: “They say that nothing begins to exist, because everything has the material from which it consists And these atoms and particles existed before the object began to exist, and therefore nothing never “begins to exist”, and the first premise is false. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And I think, what's wrong with these people?Did I always exist?Didn't I start to exist Say, at the moment when my father’s sperm and my mother merged?Did I exist before their connection? If so, where was I?Was I then somewhere in the Jurassic period when dinosaurs walked?Did I always exist? It’s just absurd to think that I never began to exist, even if the material substance from which I was made existed before me. ” So yes, according to the leading supporters of this argument, the best examples of “true creations from nothing” are actually “creations from something”. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is a completely dishonest evasion, which simply ignores the problem completely, hiding behind a smoke curtain of arrogant condescension and egregious ambiguity. But Christians will still insist that the entire cosmos itself must have a certain “beginning” of its existence, before which there was only the complete emptiness of primary, absolute non-existence - literally no matter, no energy, no space, no time, or anything else in between or beyond. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Keep in mind that when we talk about the earliest moments of the Big Bang, we are talking about the realm of ordinary human ignorance; areas where each naive intuitive guess that we have about the nature of space and time is completely incorrect and not applicable; areas where you cannot even have a meaningful conversation without subjecting yourself to the years of study in graduate school in physics and mathematics. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
So it doesn't matter what you think you know, because any conclusions you ever hope to reach about the absolute nature of everything are nothing more than wild guesses. Nevertheless, apologists will insist that sophisticated, rhetorical verbal games are all that is required to support their naive theological conclusions. For example.Prerequisite 1: A temporary series of events is a totality formed by a sequential addition. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Premise 2: The set formed by successive addition cannot be a real infinity. Therefore, a temporary series of events cannot be really endless. Or, in other words, if time cannot go back endlessly, then “nothing” should precede it. But note that this is just another dubious philosophical argument used to support a dubious philosophical argument. And, which is even more shameful, it is based on the assumption of a time that is completely false. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Because when apologists talk about time in this context, they imagine a distinct linear structure with a comprehensive past, present and future. This is a naive point of view, which, of course, corresponds to our natural intuition, but still it is absolutely erroneous. Anyone who at least knows something about modern physics knows that time does not exist, but there is a clear four-dimensional structure, known as “space-time”. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And even this look for a while, as you know, is notolor, because it cannot consistently agree with quantum mechanics. It is amazing how people with real doctoral degrees can argue with full confidence about the scientific field, which they do not understand at all. But it’s still worse, because in all this design one thing simply does not follow from the other! Only because the Universe has a certain spatio-temporal border in the final past, this does not mean that the literal “nothing” is automatically its only possible predecessor. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In the best case, all that shows is that, apparently, other physical areas outside our observed four-dimensional space-time. So what?Even if we recognize each statement up to this point, All the same, there is nothing that at least remotely hints at the need for a conscious supernatural agent. But instead of humbly to recognize your failure and just stay here, Apologists simply bring the argument to its bitter end. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
“As the cause of space and time, this creature should be an unreasonable, timeless, irresponsible, non -material being of incomprehensible power. Moreover, it should be personal.Why?Well, first of all, because this event should be outside of space and time.Therefore, it cannot be physical or material. And there are only two types of things that correspond to this description: these are either abstract objects, such as numbers, or it should be the mind. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But abstract objects cannot call anything. It follows that the cause of the Universe is the personal transcendental mind.” No kidding!Thus, the only philosophically acceptable way for the whole universe simply arise from nothing - This is through spells from the omnipotent, transcendental, eternal consciousness, which is “necessary” outside space and time.[Which, of course, is simply by chance Yahweh, the Almighty God of the Bible]. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Pay attention again, as Christians simply accept Platonic Realism for granted -As if the numbers literally “exist” in some inter-spatial world outside the space-time. But now they take another step forward to the concept known as “substantial dualism” - The idea that the minds consist of a special “substance”, which exists regardless of physical matter. This is another one of those compelling philosophical ideas that sounds really cool on paper, but is still completely wrong. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
There is simply no physical way of storing information and making solutions without any material basis that contributes to this process. That is why every “mind” in human experience has always required the physical brain that accommodates this mind. And there is no indication of any magical “substance” outside the space-time that provides this phenomenon. Remember that this should be an armor -piercing, irrefutable argument in favor of the existence of God, obtained directly from modern cosmology. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But all this turns out to be nothing more than a desperate spread of wild speculation based on naive, unverifiable rhetoric. There are so many erroneous things that you don’t even know where to start. For example, didn't we just spend half the argument concluding that literal "nothingness" is the only valid precursor to our observable spacetime? So why does God exist in this world, located outside our observed space-time?[God is not "nothing."It is something".] Moreover, how exactly incorporeal minds can causally affect the physical world somehow more than an abstract object? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Because the last time I checked, the “pure willpower” was not a working mechanism for creating whole universes from nothing. Or, even better, why is this only one only agent, and not an ensemble of seventeen creatures? Seriously, what physically checked feature of reality will change if we make it an argument in favor of politicalism instead of monotheism? Or what if we simply replace the “God” with “a race of powerful, inter -spatial creatures with amazing technology”? We can do it all day!This whole argument is so blatantly ridiculous that you just don't even want to criticize it 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
- And I just want to sit and admire all the new levels of self -deception that a person should go to to push this nonsense with a straight face. So let's stop walking around the bush and just rewrite the cosmological argument for the Kalam in essence: Prerequisite 1: Science has not yet come up with a viable, pragmatic explanation of why something exists, instead of nothing. 2: Therefore, God did it. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This is really all that it comes down to.This is an obvious argument of the “god of gaps” in his purest and most undisguised form. He does not make any tested predictions;He mixes the meaning of established expressions;He deliberately replaces concepts; he pretends to know what cannot be known; he makes blatantly false assumptions; he constructs false dichotomies; He internally contradicts himself;He uses dead philosophical ideas, and he draws logical conclusions that do not even necessarily follow from his own prerequisites. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Even if we accept the entire argument completely, we still do not get closer to understanding how the universe was actually created, What specific creature or creatures were responsible for this, or what functional influence all this could have at least in the only decision that I could ever hope to make. It is like a huge philosophical bulb of error, where each layer that you remove opens the next unforgivable layer of errors. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But all this does not matter, because initially it was not assumed that this argument would be rationally justified. This is just a frank psychological trick designed to exploit our natural aversion to the unknown and uncertainty, filling the secret of a culturally familiar agent. And since nothing inspires more reverence and uncertainty than the cosmos itself, Christians will always have an ace in their sleeve, until people learn to accept a simple and obvious fact that no one still understands how, damn it, the universe has appeared.
