So what does it mean to say that a creature, like God, does not exist? Because when you listen to religious apologists, they often convince you to believe that the only way to justify such a judgment - It is to seal absolutely every corner and gap in all physical reality, and make sure that there is empty. Of course, this is completely not what it means, and all this is known, because it is impossible to “prove the absence” in this case philosophically. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But if this is true, then how can we, in principle, say that anything does not exist? What are the epistemological grounds on which we can reject the existence of such things as a snowy man, unicorns and yahweh? Imagine that you are buying a new car, and the seller represents you the next generation car. The car, of course, looks eccentric, but its characteristics are amazing. He says that this machine not only really flies, but also takes energy from garbage and even travels in time! This is the coolest thing that you have ever heard in your life, therefore, of course, you completely believe the seller for the word and write a check for him, right? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
No.You are skeptical.Nothing of the kind exists in your experience, and, as far as you know, this cannot be at all. Thus, you demand some justification of why you should give a lot of money for this product. This is a completely reasonable request, but for some reason the seller is almost offended by it. In the end, he simply “knows in his heart” that this car can fly, and he even leads the rest of his staff to personally testify in favor of his position. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Are you convinced now?But what if he tells you that the car flies and travels in time only until you believe in it? And if it still does not fly and does not charge from garbage, then you just do not believe strongly and must continue to “strengthen your faith” until everything works.Are you convinced now? What if he threatened you with a lawsuit, imprisonment and torture, if you do not buy this car?Are you convinced now? What if the seller pulls out the board and explains the fundamental principles of cold synthesis, followed by a short course in time travel physics? 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
As far as you can judge, the logic looks completely justified, and mathematics is simple and elegant.Are you convinced now? Finally, what if he just puts you in this damn thing and spend a test drive? Then, having fought only with garbage from the nearest garbage, you really take off, fly over the city and even look at the end of the Jurassic period to photograph the dinosaurs. Are you convinced now?I would definitely be convinced! This simple story illustrates the scientific principle called "zero hypothesis." 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Because it is one thing to say that the car can fly, and completely different is to physically demonstrate it. Remember that “synthetic judgments” follow a certain set of rules, the main of which is the ability to predict events with a measurable influence in our sensory experience. Therefore, when someone is trying to tell you that his car can fly, sooner or later you should be able to jump into his car and really experience a flight. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And if you cannot, then its statement with the full basis is false. Pay attention to what internal epistemological inequality between a positive statement and its zero hypothesis. Because the statement that the machine can fly is in itself a number of predictions about our actions and their final consequences in our sensory experience. But the statement that the machine cannot fly does not carry any predictions in general, except for the continuing absence of any specific manifestations. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Thus, the physical expectations of the zero hypothesis are satisfied immediately, by default, without any action on our part. That is why the “burden of evidence” always lies with a person who makes a positive statement, and never on the person who rejects him. It is important to understand that this is not just a slight philosophical nuance, but a very real practical principle that controls our entire everyday life. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It is for this reason that the suspects in the courtroom always remain legally innocent until their fault has been proven. It is for this reason that the United States still has not invaded Canada to deliver a preemptive blow to their secret radioactive attitude to destroy the world. For this reason, no one ever tried to appease the flying space monkeys from the planet of Neptune. The lack of evidence is indeed evidence of the absence, and everything that is approved without justification can be immediately rejected without argumentation. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Thus, until Christians learn to reinforce this “God” with predictable sensory manifestations, That any arguments that they can offer are already false before they begin. Keep in your head that all this is actually reduced to the idea that the unfounded, uninhabited “I said” is not necessarily a sufficient justification for certain judgments. And yet, despite this universally recognized banality, many Christians will still rest to the last in order to shift the burden of evidence of the existence of God. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
They will say something like: “There are no good arguments that atheism is true,” or perhaps they will require “... evidence and evidence that atheism is accurate and true.” Some Christians even get to the point that the very concept of “knowledge” is redesigned specifically so that they can rationalize their faith in God without any justification in general. For example, “reformed epistemology” is a branch of apologetics, which simply accepts the existence of God in advance primarily the rest, and then interprets all human experience in this light. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Some forms of “presurationalism” even reach the assertion that we all, everywhere and everywhere, are already “know in our hearts”, that God exists, and therefore to ask for evidence simply too. And not just some kind of god, notice, namely the Christian god, described in the Bible. This is the egregious confession that their beliefs have no demonstrated influence on reality, Therefore, they have to invent a whole new set of epistemological rules, only for themselves, only in order to continue to believe, no matter what. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Thus, ceteris paribus, only the absence of evidence is already a full -fledged justification for a “strong” statement that such a thing as God does not exist. By definition, things that do not exist do not appear in our sensory experience, while what exists ultimately has such an opportunity. But religious apologists have an amazing ability to tolerate failure at all conceivable epistemological levels that you can imagine. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Because it is one thing to argue about the existence of things that “could” be real, as a powerful, personal agent, having personal interest in human affairs, But it is completely different - to believe in things that absolutely cannot be real, as an “omnipotent”, “all -wounded” creature that “necessary” exists “outside space and time”. For example, let's consider the idea of “omnipotence”, which is often defined as endless potential to do literally anything. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
It’s good if God can do anything, then let's see how God creates a stone so heavy that even God Himself cannot move him out of place. I know that I can easily personally fulfill this task, so why is it so difficult for the deity? Or, even better, can God create a creature that God Himself cannot control? How about the fact that God will create another omnipotent God, and then defeat this god in arm wrestling? Regardless of how they answer this, there will still be things outside the possibilities of an omnipotent creature. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
This illustrates another fundamental epistemological rule known as “consistency”: The idea that what properties you attribute to something, these same properties should not lead to any contradictions. The classic example of this is the idea of a “married bachelor”. By definition, the bachelor is no longer married, so everyone who is married automatically ceases to be bachelors. Consequently, married bachelors does not exist simply because this concept itself violates the axiom of the lack of contradictions. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That is why, without even getting up from my chair, I can already say with absolute accuracy that there is no “omnipotent” God either, Just by the contradictory meaning of the idea itself. But let's go further and consider the “omnipotence”, defined as an endless ability to perfect kindness, love, mercy and justice - All the properties that imply a creature that will do everything possible to minimize suffering in our world. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Theoretically, this sounds great, except for the fact that our world is obviously overwhelmed with a colossal amount of meaningless, optional suffering. Genocide, hunger, AIDS, cancer, congenital defects, mental retardation and polio - This is only a small part of those terrible deviations on the elimination of which people spend huge resources. So, even if God is really real and very powerful, then he sits in idle when crowds of people suffer terribly and meaninglessly. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Therefore, a truly “all -wound” God cannot exist already simply because the world would be happier, safer and more productive if there were no smallpox in it. Thus, we come to the principle of "falsification": The idea that whenever you describe something with the predictable impact on our sensory experience, then it would be good if these predictions would really come true. Remember that our only connection with the outside world is carried out through our senses, which are fundamentally separated from any “true and direct” perception of the Universe. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That is why we cannot “deduct” reality in the most strict sense of the word, and draw conclusions only through “logical induction”. This is the basic restriction of knowledge with which nature makes us live, but Christian philosophers will fight even against this. They will argue that induction is unreliable, or that it involves uniformity in nature, or that it is circular, or anything else. But, of course, they again misunderstood everything.By definition, induction is simply the process of forming generalizations about sets through a limited sample of subsets. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
The rationale for this process is then by considering two epistemological capabilities: If incomplete samples of a particular subset indeed indicate the behavior of the whole, then induction will lead to proper conviction in the form of predictable consequences. However, if the subset does not indicate the whole, then sooner or later any beliefs based on induction will lead to the failure of the implementation of the desired results. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In other words, when she works, she works, and when she does not, she ultimately gives you to know this. Therefore, logical induction in its very nature is self -corrective! All that is required is intellectual honesty to admit when our conclusions are erroneous, so that we can modify them in the face of new information. That is why “pharmacy” and “fraud” (refutation) are such integral aspects of the scientific method. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
In principle, both true and false beliefs can have the power to direct our actions to the desired results, But only false beliefs have the potential sometimes tolerate failure in achieving this goal. Honest people accept this, which is why honest people can be calmly overdue in their beliefs, through acquaintance with new facts and evidence. But religious apologists are not “honest people” because they come from the position of absolute, unshakable confidence. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
That is why so many Christians simply cannot but make constant attacks on science. Because science itself carries so many epistemological rules that Christians are not allowed to use in their theology. Therefore, let's be generous and suppose that God is real and wants us to know about it. What could he do to effectively demonstrate his existence?In principle, it should be very easy. Perhaps God could appear to us in various physical manifestations and personally share his unique deepest wisdom in our daily life. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Maybe God could answer our prayers, committing real acts of healing, impossible for natural reasons. Maybe God could write his name on the moon or encode his only true scripture in our DNA -Something that could be explained only if the powerful personal agent showed his interest in human affairs. But instead, what do we really have?We have a bunch of insane books with stories permeated by famous distortions and contradictions; We have dogmatic allegations of hack philosophers and theologians who are gloating refuse to recognize or correct at least one mistake in their beliefs; 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
And we have a bunch of mutually incompatible denominations, and they all declare that they represent the only absolute truth, but constantly diverge further from each other with each subsequent generation. In short, we have exactly what could be expected from a purely cultural phenomenon invented by people. That's all that means "adhere to a strong atheistic point of view."Because even if any of our concepts of God really turns out to be real, It is inevitable from this that all other thousands and thousands of gods from human history are undoubtedly false. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Thus, it is quite obvious that for people it is completely normal to invent whole religious traditions from an empty place, and any statement of one of them already implies the denial of everyone else. But this is a simple fact of logic that, although all of them cannot be true, they, of course, can all be false. Therefore, the only significant difference between an atheist and a Christian is that an atheist simply goes one step further, including Yahweh in this long list of gods, which certainly does not exist. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
Any idiot can argue that God is real, and any idiot can rationalize this statement with confusing rhetorical arguments. But only a true and living god can definitely demonstrate himself in the form of a predictable sensory manifestation. And if the apologists simply complied with this one simple criterion, then almost every person on Earth would be more than happy to believe in God and accept Christianity. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
But until this happens, we are more and more justified to immediately get to the matter, openly and proudly saying that God does not exist. “I claim that we are both atheists.I just believe in one god less than you.When you understand why you reject all other possible gods, then you will understand why I reject yours. ”- Stephen Roberts [Translated vk.com/id79920293]
