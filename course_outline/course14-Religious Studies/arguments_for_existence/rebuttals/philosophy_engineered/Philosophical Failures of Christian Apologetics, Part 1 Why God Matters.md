For nearly all of American history Christianity has enjoyed undisputed dominance over mainstream culture and media. But with the arrival of the Information Age the status has begun to falter as more and more believers find themselves falling away from the base of their parents Christian apologetics have therefore organized a dedicated campaign of lectures and debates in order to publicly defend their faith and preserve their status it's a crucial aspect of our politically charged culture war with far-reaching social consequences after

all if God is real especially the Christian God then we owe it to ourselves to understand this God and worship Him as best as we can it means the Holy Bible is the pure and righteous Word of God and we all need to start praying and studying lest we find ourselves rotting in eternal torment after this life is over however if God is not real then it means that millions upon millions of our friends family members neighbors and countrymen are all taking part in a massive self-inflicted delusion a delusion that not only

demands time money and sacrifice to sustain itself but also the political authority to legally impose itself on everyone else all of us everywhere have a serious stake in this issue and would do well to understand it as best as we can I'm a professional scientist and engineer with a doctorate of philosophy from an accredited American University I have several publications in refereed journals and I make a decent living by solving problems and pushing the limits of human understanding it's a matter of

professional interest that I understand what it means to test my beliefs against the dictates of reality and to correct them when nature tells me I'm wrong I have no personal stake in any of the beliefs I hold but simply in the rational assurance that whatever beliefs I do hold are indeed correspondent with reality I therefore measure my beliefs through a well-defined set of epistemic rules and I make no exceptions under any context that's what it takes to make new discoveries and build the knowledge of

humanity yet when it comes to religious affiliation you don't have to bother with any of that stuff at all your beliefs are practically decided for you at birth and then ground it on little more than tradition naive intuition social pressure and authority why else would religious faiths around the world segregate into such distinct cultural and geographic boundaries this is entirely unheard of in the world of physical and mathematical science but it's practically a defining feature in the world of religion it's a dead giveaway that when all is said and done

<p>
religious belief has nothing to do with an objective understanding of reality but instead is a purely cultural phenomenon of human making ordinarily this would not be so terrible except for one problem by its very nature religion and especially Christianity is never satisfied with merely sitting back and enjoying a life of quiet worship Christian doctrine itself requires believers to spread the word to everyone else and even threatens them with eternal damnation should they ever desert the cost this problem is further

amplified by a constant push to exercise legal force as a blunt instrument for imposing a narrow interpretation of Christian morality on to the rest of the nation intelligent design traditional marriage abortion and abstinence only education are just a handful of the current political controversies that are heavily motivated by the religious convictions of Christian conservatives so if there's any truth to this stuff at all then it's a good idea to find out what that truth is so we can make good decisions

accordingly and if not then abandon those beliefs and correct them so we can stop wasting political capital on pointless dogmatic superstitions that's why I feel personally compelled to understand this controversy as best as I can and to share my professional insights with the rest of the world not just to casually analyze a few political and philosophical arguments but to critically expose the very core of what it is that Christian apologetics ultimately represent it's important to realize that the debate on God's

existence is more than just a philosophical controversy between academic egos it's a battle over the very rules of epistemology itself because in the world of science if you expect to build a reliable understanding of reality then beliefs must be rigorously justified in accordance to very explicit requirements before they can ever promote the status of knowledge but when it comes to religion there are no epistemic rules to speak of no one converts to Christianity through the pure force of evidence and argumentation 
</p>
</div>

but plenty of people do convert because of tradition upbringing and social pressure so for christian apologetics the goal is not really to convince non-believers through brute intellectual force rather the only meaningful goal of apologetics is to rationalize the validity of a preconceived conclusion in order to slow the ever-increasing tide of apostasy they do this with good reason - there's big money in this stuff and even tremendous political power but it only works as long as you can maintain a

<div>
<p>
reliable pool of gullible believers to support you that's what makes education and outspoken criticism so crucial in this controversy it's the only way to break the cycle of belief and disrupt the political machine that works so hard to intrude on our lives this is also why religious groups around the world fight so hard to indoctrinate children at such young ages it's a deliberate ploy designed to unite religious affiliation with personal and social identity giving up one's religion is never as simple as casually admitting some trivial

<p>
cognitive error but the psychological equivalent of cutting off an entire arm or a lake religious criticism is therefore often met with a hypersensitive irrational resistance such that many believers will flatly refuse to ever change their my any condition whatsoever for example and my view here is that the way in which I know Christianity is true is first and foremost on the basis of the witness of the Holy Spirit in my heart and that this gives me a sailfin Takei ting means of knowing that Christianity is true

<p>
wholly apart from the evidence and therefore if in some historically contingent circumstances the evidence that I have available to me should turn against Christianity I don't think that that controverts the witness of the Holy Spirit this may sound like a harmless assertion of spiritual faith but it's also an open admission that facts simply don't matter that subjective personal experiences supersede any and all physical evidence which may ever emerge to the contrary remember that these are the exact same people who want the rest

of us to believe as they do and live as they do people who objective use to even admit the mere possibility of error in their beliefs yet insist on legislating their spiritually based morality onto the entire nation rather than engage the discussion sincerely and work together to formulate a functional understanding of our universe Christian apologetics whether they realize it or not are far more interested in engineering conformity to a foregone conclusion so if we're going to take the issue of God's existence seriously then we need

<div>
<p>
to remind ourselves that the actual existence of God himself is not important if he's real then great let's believe in him and worship Him and study him to the best of our ability but if God is not real then that's great too we can stop wasting our time at boring sermons on Sunday start making better use of our short mortal lives all that matters is that whatever beliefs we do hold those same beliefs can justifiably reflect reality it's a bitter pill of humility to be sure but if truth matters then we should all

<p>
be able to agree on this much at least now to be fair Christians do possess a whole slew of impressive sounding arguments for God's existence but their entire position boils down to just that arguments they're empty words shrouded in a thin veil of philosophical jargon without any verifiable power in the real world that's why it's so easy to discredit each and every argument that Christians have ever come up with because in the world of science when we want to convince people of a controversial idea no one ever bothers 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<p>
with cutesie philosophical rhetoric we make testable predictions and present our findings so despite the huge volumes of sophisticated philosophical posturing no Christian apologetic has ever provided a single verifiable instance of any supernatural force manifesting in our real physical world it's as if the entire Christian apologetic tradition is built on the naive supposition that merely concluding God is the same thing as demonstrating him so please join me as together we dissect the great beast of Christian apologetics not just

<div>
<p>
because we have a bone to pick with Christianity per se but because Christianity is simply the most well organized and focused of all the apologetic tradition doing so brings us face to face with the very foundations of knowledge itself and forces us to enumerate the most basic rules of epistemology in a concise unambiguous template only by basing our beliefs on a functional reflection of reality can we ever expect our decisions to have a positive impact in the real world it's a simple practical question about how
