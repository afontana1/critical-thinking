# Course overview: Historical Thinking

---

**Big question:**
How do we responsibly infer what happened in the past (and why), using incomplete, biased, and fragile evidence?

**By the end, students should be able to:**

* Explain what *historical thinking* is (as a set of reasoning practices, not a list of dates). ([American Studies at Stanford][1])
* Distinguish **primary vs. secondary sources**, and apply **source criticism** (provenance, context, purpose, reliability). ([Cornell University Press][2])
* Use structured **historical concepts** (e.g., the “Big Six,” the “5 Cs”) to analyze events and arguments. ([Historical Thinking Project][3])
* Evaluate historical claims by **corroboration**, **plausibility constraints**, and **best-explanation reasoning** (including “arguments from ignorance”). ([Penn State University Press][4])
* Explain how **interpretation** works (hermeneutics), and how meaning changes with audience, genre, and context. ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][5])
* Analyze **causal explanations** in history, including multi-causality, mechanisms, and **process tracing**. ([MIT Press][6])
* Understand major debates in **historiography** and **philosophy of history** (objectivity, narrative, progress/decline, “use/abuse” of history). ([Wikipedia][7])
* Judge popular/public historical narratives (including historical fiction and “pop history”) for evidential quality and distortion risks. ([University of Chicago Press][8])
* Design and execute a small historical research project: question → sources → method → argument → write-up. ([Google Books][9])

## Unit 1 – What Is History For?

**Guiding questions**

* What are historians trying to do: recover facts, interpret meaning, explain change, or build usable pasts?
* Can history be “objective,” and what would that mean?
* What makes historical knowledge different from memory, myth, journalism, or propaganda?

**Sub-units**

1. **History as inquiry (not a timeline)**

   * History as disciplined reasoning under uncertainty and partial records.
2. **“Usable pasts” and the ethics of historical purpose**

   * When is “usable past” illuminating vs. instrumentalizing? ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][10])
3. **Classic provocations**

   * Carr: historian and facts as mutually shaping; Collingwood and historical imagination. ([Wikipedia][7])
4. **Professional norms and institutions**

   * What a professional historical community is for (standards, peer review, archives). ([AHA][11])

   * Historical significance, evidence, continuity/change, cause/consequence, perspective, ethical dimension. ([Historical Thinking Project][3])
2. **The “5 Cs” (and why frameworks help)**

   * Change over time; context; causality; contingency; complexity. ([Middle Class History][14])
   * (Optional comparison) 9 Cs / 12 Cs as expanded classroom heuristics.
3. **A procedure view: “how to do history”**

   * A stepwise historical procedure: question → sources → criticism → interpretation → argument.

   * How “the past” shows up in identity, politics, and moral imagination.

**Core readings / media**

   * Who made it? when? how transmitted? what’s missing?
3. **Internal criticism (meaning, reliability, bias, genre)**

   * What does the author mean? what incentives shape testimony?
4. **Corroboration and triangulation**

   * Independent support; converging lines of evidence.
