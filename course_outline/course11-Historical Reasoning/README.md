## Critical Questions for Historical Sources

1. Are records acknowledged as fallible? Is it possible there are errors or mistakes?
2. Are records first-hand accounts?
3. Are records contemporary with claimed events? Are they recorded after the fact?
4. Are events independently corroborated?
5. Are events plausible under the known laws of physics and other basic scientific regularities established?
6. Are records verified by concrete relics?
7. Have records been reliably preserved?
8. Are records preserved in their native language? Were there translations?
9. Are the authors politically and socially unbiased?
10. Have the authors motivations been explicated?
