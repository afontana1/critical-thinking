# Course Overview: Argumentation Fundamentals

**Big question:**
How do *arguments* actually work in real life, and how can we *analyze, evaluate, and construct* them responsibly?

**Assumed background / bridge from Course 1**

Students are coming in having thought about:

* Epistemic virtues/vices, bullshit, ignorance, and extremism
* Language, metaphor, framing, definitions, and conceptual engineering
* Social epistemology, testimony, and epistemic injustice
* Cognitive biases, AOT, and metacognition

This course now **makes arguments the central object of study**: their structure, patterns, and evaluation, including both informal and formal tools.

**By the end, students should be able to:**

* Distinguish different *types of argument* (analogical, abductive, practical, presumptive, evidential, appeals to authority, etc.) and see them as *schemes* with associated critical questions.
* Use the **Toulmin model**, **argument mapping**, and **Walton-style argumentation schemes** to analyze real arguments. ([Cambridge University Press & Assessment][1])
* Explain the nature of **non-monotonic / defeasible reasoning** and how it differs from deductive validity. ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][2])
* Diagnose **fallacies** not just as named errors but as *systematic failures* of support, scheme misuse, or abuse of conversational norms. ([Amazon][3])
* Connect everyday argument patterns to **scientific reasoning**, **legal reasoning**, **policy deliberation**, and **interpretive argumentation**.
* See how **evidence** interacts with hypotheses and stories, and be ready to go deeper in Course 3 on evidence and evidential reasoning. ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][4])

## Unit 1 – What Arguments Are: Structure, Schemes, and Maps

**Guiding questions**

* What *is* an argument (vs. explanation, narrative, or mere disagreement)?
* Why do philosophers, lawyers, and scientists model arguments with diagrams and “schemes”?
* What’s the relationship between *logical* rigor and *informal*, real-world argument?

**Sub-units**

1. **Arguments, reasons, and conclusions**

   * Revisit but sharpen: argument vs. assertion vs. explanation vs. description.
   * Argumentation theory as the interdisciplinary study of how conclusions are supported or attacked. ([Wikipedia][5])
   * Kinds of argumentative “success”: logical strength, dialectical responsibility, and rhetorical effectiveness.

2. **The Toulmin model**

   * Claim, Data (grounds), Warrant, Backing, Qualifier, Rebuttal (CDW-BQR). ([Cambridge University Press & Assessment][1])
   * Compare Toulmin layout with standard premise–conclusion form.
   * How qualifiers and rebuttals encode *defeasibility* and burden of proof.
   * Classroom exercises: reconstruct news op-eds using Toulmin; compare multiple reconstructions.

3. **Argumentation schemes and critical questions**

   * Douglas Walton, Chris Reed & Fabrizio Macagno’s **Argumentation Schemes**: stereotypical patterns of everyday reasoning (e.g., argument from consequences, analogy, expert opinion, sign, cause, etc.). ([Cambridge University Press & Assessment][6])
   * Each scheme has associated *critical questions*—a built-in checklist for evaluation.
   * Schemes as a bridge between “logic” and what people actually do in conversation, law, and politics.

4. **Argument mapping and mining**

   * Argument mapping as box-and-arrow diagrams of premises and conclusions; contrast with concept maps and mind maps. ([Tim van Gelder][7])
   * Empirical work suggesting that mapping improves critical thinking skills and clarity.
   * Basic mapping conventions (co-premises, objections, rebuttals, hidden assumptions).
   * Argument *mining*: extracting arguments from messy, natural-language texts (e.g., online discussions, political speeches).

5. **Forms of reasoning: monotonic vs. non-monotonic**

   * Deductive validity vs. inductive strength vs. **defeasible** or **non-monotonic** inference (where new information can defeat previous conclusions). ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][2])
   * Everyday examples: default assumptions (“Birds fly”), exceptions (“Penguins”), and how these interact with argument schemes.
   * Connect back to Course 1: our cognitive systems are built to operate with defeasible, context-sensitive reasoning.

6. **Fallacies preview**

   * Very brief introduction to the idea of **formal** vs. **informal** fallacies, as *misuses* or *abuses* of argument schemes rather than mysterious named sins.
   * Position fallacies as a later deep-dive topic (Unit 8), but give students a taste (e.g., straw man, ad hominem, slippery slope) to motivate careful analysis.

* Stephen Toulmin, *The Uses of Argument*. ([Cambridge University Press & Assessment][1])
* Douglas Walton, Chris Reed & Fabrizio Macagno, *Argumentation Schemes*. ([Cambridge University Press & Assessment][6])

* Tim van Gelder, “What is argument mapping?” and “Using Argument Mapping to Improve Critical Thinking Skills.” ([Tim van Gelder][7])
* A good argumentation-theory overview (e.g., “Argumentation theory” entry). ([Wikipedia][5])

## Unit 2 – Analogical Arguments and Precedent

**Guiding questions**

* What is an *argument by analogy*?
* When are analogies illuminating vs. misleading?
* How does **precedent** work in law and policy, and what does that tell us about analogical reasoning?

**Sub-units**

1. **Basic structure of analogical arguments**

   * Classic scheme:

     * Case A has properties P, Q, R.
     * Case B has P, Q, R.
     * A has property S, so (probably) B has S.
   * Distinguish analogies used to *explain* from analogies used to *argue*.

2. **Story similarity and argument from analogy**

   * Walton’s work on **story schemes** and similarity: arguments from analogy often compare *stories* or episodes, not just lists of features. ([SSRN][9])
   * Similarity is structured by what is *salient* given the dispute (goals, causal structure, norms), not just superficial resemblance.

3. **Precedent and case-based reasoning**

   * Legal reasoning as paradigmatic analogical reasoning: *stare decisis* and “treat like cases alike.” ([Learning Research & Development Center][10])
   * Case-based reasoning in AI & Law: indexing cases, measuring similarity, and arguing from past cases to new ones. ([iamaeg.net][11])
   * Use of examples in moral and political argument: paradigm cases, slippery precedents.

4. **Shortfalls and critical questions**

   * Critical questions for analogy and precedent:

     * Are the compared cases *relevantly* similar?
     * Are there important disanalogies?
     * Is there a better, competing analogy?
   * Common pathologies: cherry-picked analogies, “abusive” historical analogies (e.g., everything becomes “like Nazi Germany”), one-off anecdotes treated as precedents.

5. **Applications**

   * Analogical arguments in bioethics, technology regulation, and social policy (e.g., “Is X *like* medical treatment or enhancement?”).
   * Exercises: students reconstruct analogical arguments from op-eds and court cases using mapping + schemes.

**Core readings**

* Douglas Walton, “Story Similarity in Arguments from Analogy” and related work on analogy and precedent. ([SSRN][9])
* Kevin Ashley, “Case-Based Reasoning and its Implications for Legal Expert Systems” or selections from *Artificial Intelligence and Legal Analytics*. ([Learning Research & Development Center][10])
* A standard CBR + law chapter (Rissland, Ashley, Branting on law and case-based reasoning). ([Folk at IDI-NTNU][12])

## Unit 3 – Abduction and Explanatory Inference

**Guiding questions**

* What is **abductive reasoning**?
* How does it differ from induction and deduction?
* Why is abduction central in science and everyday explanation?

**Sub-units**

1. **Peirce’s “abduction”**

   * Peirce’s triad: deduction, induction, abduction. ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][13])
   * Abduction as forming explanatory hypotheses—“inference to the *possible* cause.”

2. **Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE)**

   * Peter Lipton’s IBE: from data to the hypothesis that, if true, would best explain those data. ([Routledge][14])
   * Criteria for “best”: simplicity, coherence with background knowledge, explanatory power, unification, etc.
   * Differences and connections between Peircean abduction and Lipton’s IBE.

3. **Abductive patterns and schemes**

   * Walton-style schemes for argument from evidence to hypothesis, with critical questions (e.g., are there alternative explanations? is the hypothesis independently plausible?). ([windsor.scholarsportal.info][15])
   * Abduction as a *pattern of reasoning* that shows up in science, diagnosis, and everyday puzzles.

4. **Plausibility structures and hypothesis spaces**

   * “Plausibility structures” as the background of what we can even *imagine* as a candidate explanation (bridge to Course 1 on framing, narratives, and echo chambers).
   * Hypothesis spaces and a gentle, non-mathematical intro to **Bayesian confirmation**:

     * Evidence updates degrees of belief in different hypotheses. ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][4])
     * Many hypotheses can fit the same data (underdetermination).
     * Total evidence: why cherry-picked data mislead.

5. **Critical questions for abduction**

   * Are we considering enough alternatives? (problem of unconceived alternatives).
   * Are we overweighting simplicity or “fit” relative to prior credibility?
   * How do social structures (experts, institutions) shape which hypotheses get taken seriously?

**Core readings**

* Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on abduction / Peirce. ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][13])
* Peter Lipton, *Inference to the Best Explanation*. ([Routledge][14])
* V. Crupi, “Confirmation” (SEP), and short intros to Bayesian confirmation theory (Strevens, Hawthorne, Fitelson). ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][4])
* Douglas Walton, selections on abductive schemes and argument from evidence. ([windsor.scholarsportal.info][15])

## Unit 4 – Practical Reasoning and Decision

**Guiding questions**

* How do we argue about what to *do*, not just what’s *true*?
* How do goals, values, and consequences enter practical arguments?
* What is the relationship between practical reasoning and decision theory?

**Sub-units**

1. **Practical reasoning schemes**

   * Walton’s basic practical reasoning scheme:

     * Goal G; doing A promotes G; therefore, (presumably) do A. ([SSRN][16])
   * Variants: value-based practical reasoning, arguments from consequences, slippery slope variants.

2. **Decision theory, very lightly**

   * Decision theory / rational choice: maximizing expected utility given preferences and beliefs, in conditions of risk and uncertainty. ([Wikipedia][17])
   * How decision theory abstracts practical reasoning patterns.
   * Points of contact and tension between normative decision theory and messy real-life deliberation (cognitive limits from Course 1).

3. **Values, ends, and “oughts”**

   * Practical reasoning as inescapably *value-laden*: we reason about what is good, better, worse, fair, etc.
   * Aristotle, endoxa, and arguments about what’s choiceworthy or virtuous (bridge to virtue epistemology). ([Wikipedia][18])
   * Distinguish: instrumental “means–ends” arguments vs. arguments about *which ends* to adopt.

4. **Critical questions and limitations**

   * Are the stated goals legitimate? Are they shared?
   * Does action A *really* promote G, or are there hidden side effects, opportunity costs, or value conflicts?
   * Is the agent’s information adequate? Are there better options not considered?

5. **Policy and public reasoning**

   * Practical reasoning in public policy: cost–benefit analysis, precautionary principle, appeals to rights and justice.
   * Exercises: map practical arguments in policy debates (e.g., climate policy, public health, surveillance) in Toulmin + scheme format.

**Core readings**

* Douglas Walton, “Explanations and Arguments Based on Practical Reasoning” and related work on practical reasoning schemes. ([ResearchGate][19])
* Christian Kock, “Is Practical Reasoning Presumptive?” (for a critical view of Walton). ([informallogic.ca][20])

---

## Unit 5 – Presumption, Presupposition, and Assumption

**Guiding questions**

* What is **presumption** in argument, and how is it different from assumption or presupposition?
* How do burdens of proof shift in dialogue?
* How do presuppositions smuggle in background commitments?

**Sub-units**

1. **Presumptive reasoning**

   * Walton’s account: presumptions as defeasible, context-dependent starting points that shift burdens of proof. ([Routledge][8])
   * Presumptive reasoning as essential to everyday and legal argument (we can’t prove everything from scratch).
   * Godden and others on presumption as a “negative” logic—reasonable in absence of defeating evidence. ([PhilArchive][22])

2. **Assumptions vs. presuppositions**

   * **Assumptions** as explicit or implicit premises used “for the sake of argument.”
   * **Presuppositions** as background commitments required for an utterance to make sense (definite descriptions, factive verbs, etc.). ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][23])
   * Connect to Course 1 on implicature, framing, and doublespeak.

3. **Legal and evidential contexts**

   * Presumptions in law (e.g., presumption of innocence) as devices that affect how evidence is treated and who carries which burden. ([Cambridge University Press & Assessment][24])
   * Legal standards of proof and the structure of fact-finding dialogues.

4. **Critical questions**

   * On what basis is the presumption adopted? Is it defeasible in this context?
   * Who benefits from the current distribution of presumptions and burdens?
   * Are we smuggling controversial claims in as presuppositions (“When did you stop doing X?”)?

**Core readings**

* Douglas Walton, *Argumentation Schemes for Presumptive Reasoning*. ([Routledge][8])
* D.M. Godden, “A Theory of Presumption for Everyday Argumentation.” ([PhilArchive][22])

## Unit 6 – Evidence and Story-Based Reasoning (Bridge to Course 3)

**Guiding questions**

* How does *evidence* function in arguments?
* What does it mean to say that evidence “supports” a hypothesis or story?
* How do stories and arguments interact in legal and scientific contexts?

**Sub-units**

1. **Evidence schemes**

   * Walton’s schemes involving evidence: argument from sign, argument from evidence to hypothesis, argument from correlation to cause, etc., with critical questions. ([windsor.scholarsportal.info][15])
   * Total evidence requirement: dangers of selective evidence and one-sided case-building.

2. **Story schemes and evidence**

   * Bex and others: hybrid **stories-and-arguments** models—legal fact-finding requires both argument schemes and narrative coherence. ([PMC][25])
   * “Story schemes” as patterns for constructing plausible narratives from fragments of evidence.

3. **Multiple hypotheses and underdetermination**

   * Evidence can be compatible with multiple hypotheses; link back to Unit 3 (abduction, IBE).
   * The role of background assumptions and prior probabilities in shaping which explanation seems “best.”

4. **What counts as evidence? (very general)**

   * Distinguish: raw data, observations, reports, experimental results, testimonies, statistical patterns.
   * Bridge to Course 3: reliability of measurement, causal inference, confounding, and social dimensions of evidence will be developed later.

**Core readings**

* Douglas Walton, selections on arguments from evidence and sign. ([windsor.scholarsportal.info][15])
* Floris Bex, “Story Schemes for Argumentation about the Facts of a Crime” and “The Hybrid Theory of Stories and Arguments.” ([ai.rug.nl][26])
* A short, accessible piece on evidence and confirmation (e.g., a chapter from a philosophy of science intro or SEP “Confirmation”). ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][4])

---

## Unit 7 – Arguments from Authority and Expert Opinion

**Guiding questions**

* When is it reasonable to defer to experts?
* What makes an appeal to authority legitimate vs. fallacious?
* How do we evaluate expert disagreement?

**Sub-units**

1. **Scheme for argument from expert opinion**

   * Walton’s canonical scheme for appeal to expert opinion (source E is an expert in domain D, says A, so (presumably) A). ([psupress.org][27])
   * Associated critical questions: credentials, domain match, consensus, bias, track record, etc.

2. **The expert identification problem**

   * Wagemans and others on reconstructing and evaluating arguments from expert opinion. ([SpringerLink][28])
   * How media, institutions, and social networks signal “expertise” (bridge to Course 1’s social epistemology and epistemic injustice).

3. **Expert disagreement and lay audiences**

   * How non-experts should reason when experts disagree: strategies other than cherry-picking the expert who agrees with your prior.
   * Interaction with trust, epistemic vigilance, and echo chambers (explicitly tie back to Course 1 Unit 6).

4. **Fallacious appeals to authority**

   * Misapplied domain, fake or bought expertise, celebrity authority, and pseudo-experts.
   * Exercises: diagnose authority appeals in ads, political debates, and online discourse using the scheme + questions.

**Core readings**

* Douglas Walton, *Appeal to Expert Opinion: Arguments from Authority*. ([psupress.org][27])
* J.H.M. Wagemans, “The Assessment of Argumentation from Expert Opinion.” ([SpringerLink][28])
* A short social-epistemology piece on expertise and trust (can build on Goldman, Fricker, and C. Thi Nguyen from Course 1).

---

## Unit 8 – Fallacies as Argumentative Pathologies

**Guiding questions**

* What are fallacies, *really*?
* How do they relate to argument schemes, conversational norms, and cognitive biases?
* How can we go beyond fallacy-spotting to serious diagnosis and repair?

**Sub-units**

1. **Families of fallacies**

   * Formal vs. informal; fallacies of relevance, ambiguity, presumption, weak induction, etc. ([Amazon][3])
   * Connect to Course 1: many fallacies track cognitive biases and social pressures rather than sheer stupidity.

2. **Fallacies as *misused schemes***

   * Straw man, ad hominem, slippery slope, appeal to popularity, etc., interpreted as distortions of otherwise legitimate schemes.
   * For each, identify:

     * Underlying scheme
     * What gets distorted (e.g., misrepresentation, missing premises, bad similarity claim).

3. **Formal fallacies**

   * Affirming the consequent, denying the antecedent, quantifier fallacies, etc.
   * How they relate to intuitive but invalid patterns of reasoning.

4. **Pedagogical and practical issues**

   * Why “fallacy bingo” can mislead: disagreements about classification, context-sensitivity, and the rhetorical function of some “fallacious” moves.
   * Exercises in *repairing* fallacious arguments into stronger ones.

**Core readings**

* Jacob E. Van Vleet, *Informal Logical Fallacies: A Brief Guide*. ([Amazon][3])
* Classic fallacy chapters from Copi or Hurley’s *Introduction to Logic* and online fallacy guides. ([criticalthinking.org][29])
* A critical piece on the limits of traditional fallacy taxonomy (e.g., from informal logic literature).

---

## Unit 9 – Formal Reasoning, Non-Classical Logics, and Their Limits

**Guiding questions**

* What does formal logic contribute to the study of argument?
* What are the limits of formalization for real-world reasoning?
* What are “non-classical logics,” and why do they exist?

**Sub-units**

1. **Propositional logic basics**

   * Propositions, connectives, truth tables, valid forms (modus ponens, modus tollens, etc.).
   * Relationship to formal fallacies (affirming the consequent, denying the antecedent, etc.).

2. **Rules of inference and proofs**

   * Natural deduction or Fitch-style proofs at a basic level; how they represent chains of valid inference.
   * Emphasize: this is a *tool* for certain tasks, not the whole of reasoning.

3. **Defeasible reasoning vs. monotonic logic**

   * Reconnect with Unit 1: classical logic is monotonic; real reasoning is often non-monotonic and defeasible.
   * Introduce non-monotonic logic as a family of formalisms for defeasible reasoning. ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][2])

4. **Very brief tour of non-classical logics**

   * Mention (at high altitude): modal, deontic, relevant, paraconsistent, default logics, etc., and what problems they address (obligation, knowledge, inconsistency, defaults). ([Horty][30])
   * Aim: give students a sense that “logic” is plural and context-sensitive, without going technical.

5. **Limits and misapplications**

   * Dangers of forcing messy ethical, political, or legal disputes into overly sanitized logical forms.
   * When formalization clarifies vs. when it distorts.

**Core readings**

* A standard introductory logic text (selected chapters on propositional logic and proofs).
* SEP or concise overviews on non-monotonic logic and nonmonotonic inference. ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][2])
* A short piece (e.g., Norton, Oaksford & Chater, or cognitive logic work) on the gap between classical logic and human reasoning. ([iccm-conference.neocities.org][31])

---

## Unit 10 – Extensions: Interpretive, Quasi-Logical, and Case-Based Arguments

**Guiding questions**

* How do argument schemes extend into interpretation, rhetoric, and case-based reasoning?
* What are **quasi-logical** arguments, and why are they powerful?
* How do “common knowledge” and endoxa function in public argument?

---

### 1. **Interpretive argument schemes**

* Legal hermeneutics and interpretive arguments: how we argue about the *meaning* of texts (constitutions, statutes, sacred texts). ([Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy][32])

  * Different styles of legal reasoning: textualism, originalism, purposivism, Dworkinian “law as integrity,” etc., as rival *interpretive* schemes.
  * [Statutory Interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_interpretation): how courts appeal to canons (plain meaning, legislative intent, precedent) as recurring argument patterns for what statutes mean.
  * [Legal Reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Legal_reasoning): analogy, precedent, and policy arguments as *families* of interpretive schemes rather than just applications of formal logic.

* Gadamerian/hermeneutic insights: pre-understanding, tradition, and the circularity of interpretation (light touch, focusing on argument structure).

  * “Fusion of horizons” as a way to understand why interpretive arguments always start from some historically situated **endoxa** (received opinions, traditions).
  * Hermeneutic circle as a *recursive* structure: we interpret the part by the whole and the whole by the parts; arguments about meaning often oscillate between “local” textual details and “global” narrative or doctrinal coherence.

* **Diagrammatic reasoning** as an interpretive aid.

  * [Diagrammatic Reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagrammatic_reasoning): using diagrams, flowcharts, charts, or timelines to represent complex interpretive options and their consequences.
  * Connect to argument mapping: diagrams and concept maps can make visible the structure of competing interpretations (e.g., branching interpretations of a constitutional clause, or a statutory phrase under different canons).

* **Model-based reasoning (intro level, to be developed later).**

  * [Model-Based Reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-based_reasoning): using idealized models to interpret and reason about systems (e.g., “the market,” “the family,” “the constitution-as-contract”).
  * Here: just flag that interpretive arguments often rely on *models*—simplified structures of how institutions or practices work—which will be treated more formally in your later unit on model-based thinking.

---

### 2. **Arguments from common knowledge / endoxa**

* Aristotle’s *Topics* and *Rhetoric* on endoxa—reputable opinions as starting points for argument. ([Wikipedia][18])

  * Endoxa as “what the many and the wise accept”: a structured resource of *common opinions* from which topoi (topics/argument schemes) are drawn.
  * [Aristotle’s Topics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topics_%28Aristotle%29) as an ancient “catalogue of argument moves”: loci for definition, genus–species, part–whole, more/less, cause/effect, etc.

* Endoxa today: appeals to “what everyone knows,” “common sense,” or “what we as a society believe.”

  * [Commonsense Reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_reasoning): in AI and philosophy, attempts to formalize this background of shared expectations, folk physics/psychology, and cultural scripts.
  * Connection to Course 1: “common sense” can be epistemically virtuous (efficient, reliable in everyday contexts) but also encode prejudice, ideology, and epistemic injustice.

* Commonsense reasoning and **default assumptions**.

  * Everyday endoxa often function as *defaults* in defeasible reasoning (“Normally, people tell the truth,” “Usually, prices rise when demand increases.”).
  * These defaults supply *unspoken premises* in argument schemes—for example, arguments from sign, analogy, or practical reasoning that rely on what is “normally” the case.

* **Metaphorical reasoning** as a structured extension of endoxa.

  * [Metaphorical Reasoning](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaphor/): our shared metaphors (“argument is war,” “the body politic,” “the marketplace of ideas”) embed both descriptive and normative endoxa.
  * Connect to Course 1 on conceptual metaphor: many appeals to “common sense” are in fact appeals to entrenched **metaphorical models** of the domain (e.g., crime as a “beast” vs. a “virus”).

---

### 3. **Quasi-logical arguments**

* Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca’s **New Rhetoric**: quasi-logical arguments that *look* like formal proofs but are actually defeasible and context-sensitive. ([JSTOR][33])

  * They mimic structures like transitivity, contradiction, inclusion, probability calculus, etc., but work on evaluative or vague material (“more just,” “more natural,” “closer to the original meaning”).
  * Examples:

    * “If A is more X than B, and B is more X than C, then A is more X than C.”
    * “Either you support policy P or you don’t care about group G.”

* Their psychological power: they piggyback on people’s respect for formal logic.

  * Because they **resemble** deductive or mathematical forms, audiences often treat them as if they had the same certainty, even though premises are vague, contestable, or implicitly value-laden.
  * Important for critical thinking: learning to *separate* the quasi-logical surface from the substantive premises about values, similarity, or probability.

* Relationship to **diagrammatic reasoning** and visual quasi-logic.

  * Graphs, charts, flow diagrams, and “scorecards” can visually instantiate quasi-logical arguments (“this line is always above that one”; “this cluster dominates that cluster”), without explicit premises stated.
  * Students can practice re-constructing the underlying quasi-logical pattern from a diagram, then asking what hidden assumptions make it persuasive.

* Link back to **metaphor** and **framing**.

  * Quasi-logical arguments often sit on top of metaphors (“slippery slope,” “domino effect,” “tipping point”), which quietly supply the inferential structure that makes the quasi-logic feel natural.

---

### 4. **Case-based and narrative extensions**

* Extend Unit 2 & 6: **case-based reasoning** outside law (medicine, ethics, policy, AI explainability). ([Learning Research & Development Center][10])

  * [Case-Based Reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-based_reasoning): solving new problems by adapting solutions from similar past cases.
  * In medicine: diagnosis by similarity to previous patients; in ethics: use of paradigm cases and analogies; in AI: retrieval–adaptation cycles as a reasoning architecture.

* “Interpretive arguments” about how to classify or narrate a case (e.g., is this “self-defense,” “terrorism,” “whistleblowing”?).

  * Competing narratives structure the *salient facts*, the *normative categories*, and the *relevant precedents*.
  * This is where **legal reasoning** and **narrative reasoning** intersect: the same facts can be narrated under different legal or moral labels, each backed by analogical and precedential schemes.

* **Model-based reasoning**, revisited in a case/narrative context (still intro level).

  * Scientists, historians, and lawyers often build *models* (idealized causal or institutional structures) and then ask: which model best fits this case?
  * Use this only at a high level: emphasize that later you’ll have a dedicated unit on model-based thinking and scientific modeling.

* **Procedural reasoning** as a way of organizing action-guiding narratives.

  * [Procedural Reasoning System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_reasoning_system): in AI, PRS frameworks treat agents as following procedures or plans sensitive to beliefs, desires, and intentions.
  * Connect this to practical and case-based reasoning: arguments can appeal not just to outcomes or precedents, but to *procedures* (“Follow this algorithm,” “the protocol says…”) as an authoritative structure.

* **Counterfactual conditionals** and counterfactual thinking (high level, to be deepened in a causation course).

  * [Counterfactual Conditionals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfactual_conditional): “If X had not happened, Y would not have occurred.”
  * In case-based and causal reasoning, we often argue by comparing the actual case to counterfactual scenarios (“Had the company warned consumers, the harm would have been avoided”).
  * Flag this as a bridge to your later course on **causation and counterfactual reasoning**: here students just learn to recognize counterfactual moves as a distinct argumentative pattern.

---

### 5. **Deceptive definitions and quasi-logical abuse**

* Return briefly to conceptual engineering from Course 1: how persuasive definitions and quasi-logical structures intertwine.

  * A persuasive or re-engineered definition (“Patriotism is unconditional loyalty to the state”) can then be plugged into a quasi-logical argument:

    * “If you criticize the state, you’re not patriotic;
      If you’re not patriotic, you’re disloyal;
      Therefore…”
  * This gives the *appearance* of strict logical necessity while the real work is done by the loaded definition.

* Illustrate “quasi-formal” arguments that hide controversial re-definitions under a veneer of logical rigor.

  * Students can practice:

    * Identifying where a controversial definition or classification is introduced.
    * Reconstructing the argument both with and without the redefinition to see how much force it adds.

* **Arguments from ignorance** and arguments from silence as borderline cases.

  * [Argument from Ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance): “We have no evidence that p, therefore ¬p” (or vice versa).
  * Walton’s *Arguments from Ignorance* stresses that such arguments can be *reasonable* when the search space is well defined and a competent search has been performed (e.g., “No record in the database → the person is not registered”). ([Penn State University Press][34])
  * **Arguments from silence** (especially in law and history): inferring from the absence of expected testimony or documents.

    * Students examine when silence is evidential (if someone would *normally* speak up) vs. when it is neutral (silence is common, or costly to break).
  * You can connect this to **negative paradigms** and default reasoning: sometimes the absence of a positive case (no counterexample, no complaint, no anomaly) is treated as indirect support for a generalization—again, defeasible and context-sensitive.

* **Commonsense and metaphorical abuse.**

  * Appeals to “common sense” (“Everyone knows…”) can be combined with quasi-logical form and loaded definitions to construct arguments that seem obvious but are actually built on highly contestable background metaphors and endoxa.
  * This ties the course back to:

    * Course 1 (metaphor, framing, conceptual engineering).
    * Earlier units here (endoxa, quasi-logical arguments, case-based narratives).

* Chaim Perelman & Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca, *The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation* (sections on quasi-logical arguments). ([JSTOR][33])
* Aristotle, *Topics* and *Rhetoric* (selections on endoxa and rhetorical/dialectical argument). ([Wikipedia][18])
* Legal hermeneutics / legal interpretation (e.g., IEP “Legal Hermeneutics,” SEP “Legal Interpretation”). ([Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy][32])
* Ashley, *Artificial Intelligence and Legal Analytics* (for case-based reasoning and interpretive models). ([iamaeg.net][11])
* Supplemental “extension” readings (short, carefully curated excerpts):

  * On **model-based reasoning**: e.g., Nersessian on model-based reasoning in science, or a short survey of [Model-Based Reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-based_reasoning). ([Mechanism][35])
  * On **diagrammatic reasoning**: a brief overview of [Diagrammatic Reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagrammatic_reasoning) and its relation to logical and conceptual representation. ([Wikipedia][36])
  * On **procedural reasoning systems**: a short accessible explanation of PRS and BDI agents. ([Wikipedia][37])
  * On **commonsense reasoning**: Davis & Marcus, “Commonsense Reasoning and Commonsense Knowledge in AI,” or an accessible overview of [Commonsense Reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_reasoning). ([Wikipedia][38])
  * On **arguments from ignorance and silence**: Douglas Walton, *Arguments from Ignorance*, plus a short article on argument from silence. ([Penn State University Press][34])
  * On **metaphor and reasoning**: SEP entry on [Metaphor](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaphor/) (selected sections on cognitive and inferential roles of metaphor).

## Possible capstone activities

* **Argument Mapping & Scheme Analysis Project**

  Students choose a substantive real-world issue (e.g., public health policy, climate litigation, AI regulation, campus speech controversies) and:

  * Collect a small corpus of argumentative texts (op-eds, policy briefs, legal opinions, debates).
  * Produce detailed **argument maps** (Toulmin-style + mapping software if available).
  * Classify key arguments using **Walton-style schemes** (analogy, practical reasoning, expert opinion, evidence, etc.) and apply corresponding **critical questions**.
  * Diagnose fallacies and *scheme misuses* rather than just naming fallacy labels.
  * Reflect on:

    * Where reasoning is **defeasible** and how new evidence or counterarguments would shift conclusions.
    * How **evidence** is used to support stories and hypotheses (bridge to Course 3).
    * How **language, framing, and conceptual choices** inherited from Course 1 shape what counts as a good argument here.

*Optional: short in-class “mini-capstone” where groups analyze and repair a heavily flawed argumentative text, turning it into a more virtuous and transparent piece of reasoning.*

If you’d like, next step could be: I take one unit (say, Unit 3 on abduction or Unit 7 on expert opinion) and flesh it out down to the **week-by-week / class session level** with activities, prompts, and specific passages from these readings.
