## 1. From Parts to Wholes: Why Systems?

### Goals

- Bridge from analytical thinking (“take apart”) to systems thinking (“see interactions”).
- Show when reductionism fails: unintended consequences, policy resistance, “whack-a-mole” problems.
- Give memorable examples (traffic, healthcare, social media, climate, personal habits).

### Subsections

#### 1.1 Reductionism vs. Holism

- Core idea: Analytical thinking isolates variables; systems thinking asks, *“What is this part embedded in?”*
- Example: treating symptoms vs. addressing root causes in health or organizations.
- Link to later topics: motivates the need for **feedback**, **archetypes**, and **design**.

#### 1.2 What is a System?

- Working definition: *A system is a set of elements, connected in such a way that they produce a pattern of behavior over time.*
- Highlight:
  - **Elements** (people, parts, resources)
  - **Interconnections** (relationships, flows, rules)
  - **Purpose/behavior** (what the system actually does over time)
- Emphasize: “The purpose of a system is what it *does*,” not what it says on the box.

#### 1.3 Seeing Systems in Everyday Life

- Micro: morning routines, personal finance, productivity.
- Meso: teams, departments, product launches.
- Macro: economies, ecosystems, platforms.
- Possible activity: ask learners to list **3 systems** they are part of daily and how those systems shape their behavior.

### Readings

## 2. Systems Thinking (as a Habit of Mind)

### Goals

- Build a **conceptual toolbox**: stocks, flows, feedback loops, delays, boundaries, leverage.
- Emphasize **mental models and framing**: how you draw the system changes what you see.
- Prepare learners for **archetypes** and **system dynamics**.

### Subsections

#### 2.1 Stocks and Flows

- **Stock** = accumulation (water in a bathtub, customers, reputation, skills).
- **Flow** = rate of change (faucet/drain, new users per day, practice hours).
- Key insight: behavior is often driven by **accumulation over time**, not isolated events.  

#### 2.2 Feedback Loops (Reinforcing & Balancing)

- **Reinforcing loops** (R):
  - “The rich get richer,” compounding interest, product virality.
  - Self-reinforcing growth or decline.
- **Balancing loops** (B):
  - Homeostasis: thermostats, regulation, habit patterns that keep things steady.
- Multiple loops act simultaneously and often in tension.

#### 2.3 Delays and Nonlinearity

- **Delays**: actions now → results much later (skills building, trust, climate).
- **Nonlinearity**:
  - Thresholds: nothing happens, nothing happens… then suddenly a big change.
  - Diminishing returns and saturation.
- Many problematic patterns (overshoot, oscillations) arise from **feedback + delays**.

#### 2.4 Boundaries and Levels of System

- The boundary you draw defines what “counts” in your system.
- Example: obesity as:
  - An individual willpower problem,
  - A food environment problem,
  - A socioeconomic and policy system problem.
- Exercise: redraw a simple problem (e.g., “meetings are unproductive”) with a wider boundary.

#### 2.5 Leverage Points

- Places where a small, well-chosen change can shift overall behavior:
  - Parameters (subsidies, taxes),
  - Information flows (what gets measured or seen),
  - Rules (who can decide what),
  - Goals & paradigms (what the system is “for”).
- Preview: will return in **system design** and **policy** discussions.

### Readings

- **Core**
  - Donella H. Meadows – *Thinking in Systems*, Chapters 2–3 (stocks/flows, feedback, system traps)
- **Supplement**
  - Peter Senge – *The Fifth Discipline*, sections on feedback, learning disabilities, and “11 laws of the fifth discipline.”
- **More resources**
  - Linda Booth Sweeney & Dennis Meadows – *The Systems Thinking Playbook* (hands-on activities to illustrate feedback and delays).

## 3. Systems Science / General Systems Theory

### Goals

- Situate systems thinking in a broader intellectual tradition.
- Emphasize **general principles** that cut across disciplines: feedback, homeostasis, emergence.
- Provide just enough history to give conceptual depth, without turning into an academic survey.

### Subsections

#### 3.1 A Very Short History of Systems Science

- General Systems Theory (Ludwig von Bertalanffy) – systems as wholes, not just parts.  
- Cybernetics (Norbert Wiener, W. Ross Ashby) – control and communication in animals, machines, and organizations.  
- System dynamics (Jay Forrester, later Sterman and others at MIT).

#### 3.2 Core Principles Across Domains

- **Equifinality** – different paths can lead to similar outcomes.
- **Homeostasis** – stability through balancing feedback (e.g., body temperature, budgets).
- **Emergent behavior** – patterns at the whole-system level that can’t be seen by looking only at parts.
- **Self-organization** – structures/patterns arising without central control.

#### 3.3 Open vs. Closed Systems

- **Closed**: no exchange of matter/energy/information (mostly idealized).
- **Open**: real-world systems that exchange all three (economies, ecosystems, organizations).
- Many failures come from treating open systems as if they were closed.

#### 3.4 Information and Control

- Negative feedback as control mechanism (thermostats, autopilot, homeostatic regulation).
- Information delays, distortion, and missing feedback → oscillations, instability, and policy failure.
- Sets up **system dynamics** and **complex systems**.

### Readings

- **Core**
  - A general introduction to systems thinking/systems theory, e.g.:
    - Donella H. Meadows – relevant conceptual sections of *Thinking in Systems* (history + general principles).
- **More resources**
  - Ludwig von Bertalanffy – *General System Theory* (classic but more academic).
  - Norbert Wiener – *Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine* (selected conceptual chapters).

## 4. Systems Analysis (without heavy math)

### Goals

- Show learners how to **analyze** situations as systems using simple tools.
- Provide practical methods: mapping, asking better questions, identifying feedback and delays.
- Keep it conceptual and visual, not equation-driven.

### Subsections

#### 4.1 Framing a Problem as a System

- Ask: “What **behavior over time** are we trying to understand or change?”
- Identify:
  - Stakeholders,
  - Key **stocks** (what accumulates),
  - **Flows** (what changes those stocks),
  - Existing **goals** and implicit incentives.

#### 4.2 Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs) – Light Version

- Simple symbols: cause → effect, with **R** (reinforcing) and **B** (balancing) labels.
- Examples:
  - Procrastination loop (short-term relief vs. long-term stress).
  - Startup growth vs. burnout (hiring, workload, quality).
- Emphasize conceptual clarity over diagram aesthetics.

#### 4.3 Behavior Over Time Graphs (BOTGs)

- Qualitative sketches of trends:
  - Rising, falling, S-shaped growth, oscillation, overshoot and collapse.
- Question: “What system structure could produce this pattern?”
- Bridges directly to **archetypes** and **system dynamics**.

#### 4.4 Finding Structural Causes vs. Blame

- Key mindset: “**Structure produces behavior**” more than individual heroics or villainy.  
- Helps move from blame narratives toward structural interventions.

#### 4.5 Limits of Systems Analysis

- Uncertainty and incomplete data.
- Risk of overcomplicating (drawing a huge diagram instead of focusing on key loops).
- Danger of believing your diagram **is** reality.
- Sets up the idea that **formal models** (next unit) are just **more explicit system stories**, not reality itself.

### Readings

- **Core**
  - Donella H. Meadows – *Thinking in Systems*, sections on “Why Systems Surprise Us” and “System Traps.” 
- **Supplement**
  - Michael Goodman – materials on applying systems thinking and archetypes to organizational issues (e.g., Pegasus/Systems Thinker resources).  
- **More resources**
  - Virginia Anderson & Lauren Johnson – *Systems Thinking Basics: From Concepts to Causal Loops* (great for CLDs + BOTGs).

## 5. System Design (and Redesign)

### Goals

- Help learners think about **changing** systems, not just diagnosing them.
- Introduce design principles: alignment of goals, incentives, feedback, and information flows.
- Bring in the ethics and unintended consequences of interventions.

### Subsections

#### 5.1 From Analysis to Design

- Once you see “structure → behavior,” ask:
  - “What structure would produce the behavior we want?”
- Emphasize:
  - Small, testable changes,
  - Iterative interventions over grand one-shot reforms.

#### 5.2 Designing Incentives and Feedback

- Align incentives with system goals:
  - E.g., measure **quality and long-term outcomes**, not just short-term output.
- Make feedback timely and visible:
  - Dashboards, retrospectives, customer feedback loops.

#### 5.3 Designing Information Flows

- Many leverage points involve **changing who knows what and when**:
  - Error reporting systems,
  - Transparent performance metrics,
  - Cross-functional reviews.
- Example: aviation safety culture vs. blame culture.

#### 5.4 Rules, Constraints, and Norms

- Distinguish:
  - Formal rules (laws, policies),
  - Informal norms (culture, unwritten rules).
- Changing rules or norms can be higher leverage than “pushing people harder.”  

#### 5.5 Ethics of System Design

- Interventions redistribute power, risk, and benefits.
- Key questions:
  - “Who gains, who loses, and who decides?”
  - “Are we designing for **resilience** or just **efficiency**?”

### Readings

- **Core**
  - Donella H. Meadows – *Thinking in Systems*, “Leverage Points” and “Living in a World of Systems.” 
- **More resources**
  - Leyla Acaroglu – essays on systems thinking, systems mapping, and circular design (e.g., “Tools for Systems Thinkers: Systems Mapping”). 
  - Richard H. Thaler & Cass Sunstein – *Nudge* (not “systems thinking” per se, but good illustration of design of choice architectures and feedback).

## 6. System Archetypes

### Goals

- Give learners a **pattern library** of recurring systemic behaviors.
- Train pattern recognition: “Oh, this looks like ‘Fixes that Fail’ rather than a one-off blunder.”
- Link archetypes back to CLDs and BOTGs.

### Subsections

#### 6.1 What Are Archetypes?

- **System archetypes** = recurring patterns of structure + behavior across different domains.
- Similar idea to:
  - Design patterns (software),
  - Logical fallacies (argumentation),
  - Narrative tropes (storytelling).

#### 6.2 Core Archetypes to Cover

For each archetype, cover:
- Typical structure,  
- Behavior over time,  
- Everyday example,  
- One or two leverage ideas.

Examples:

- **Fixes that Fail**
  - Quick fix solves symptom → side effects worsen the underlying problem.
  - Example: price discounts to boost sales that erode brand value.
- **Shifting the Burden**
  - Reliance on symptomatic solutions prevents investment in fundamental solutions.
  - Example: overuse of painkillers instead of addressing underlying lifestyle causes.
- **Limits to Growth / Success**
  - Early growth eventually hits internal constraints (capacity, trust, attention).  
- **Drifting (Eroding) Goals**
  - Lowering standards rather than improving performance when targets are missed.
- **Tragedy of the Commons**
  - Shared resource overuse due to uncoordinated self-interest.
- **Success to the Successful**
  - Small initial advantages are reinforced structurally, leading to inequality.  

#### 6.3 Using Archetypes as Diagnostic Tools

- Given a few data points (trend + symptoms), ask:
  - “Which archetype does this resemble?”
- Combine with:
  - CLDs (structure),
  - BOTGs (behavior),
  - Stories from stakeholders.

#### 6.4 Archetypes and Critical Thinking

- Treat archetypes as **hypotheses**, not labels:
  - “This might be ‘Shifting the Burden’; what evidence would confirm or falsify that?”
- Avoid forcing every situation into a favorite pattern.

### Readings

- **Core**
  - Daniel H. Kim – *Systems Archetype Basics: From Story to Structure*
  - “Systems Archetypes I” (Pegasus/Systems Thinker series).
- **Supplement**
  - Leyla Acaroglu – “Tools for Systems Thinkers: The 12 Recurring Systems Archetypes.” 
- **More resources**
  - Peter Senge – *The Fifth Discipline*, chapters on system archetypes and “The Eleven Laws.”

## 7. System Dynamics (Conceptual, Not Math-Heavy)

### Goals

- Explain why systems produce particular **behavior over time**:
  - growth, decay, oscillation, overshoot & collapse.
- Give intuitive system-dynamics insight without equations or software.
- Prepare learners for the idea of **formal models** in the upcoming “Model Thinking” section.

### Subsections

#### 7.1 What is System Dynamics?

- Field pioneered by **Jay Forrester** at MIT; later expanded by John Sterman and others. 
- Focus: feedback-driven behavior of systems over time.
- Distinguish:
  - **System dynamics thinking** (mental models, CLDs, stock–flow diagrams),
  - **Formal modeling** (simulation).

#### 7.2 Canonical Dynamic Behaviors

- **Exponential growth / decay**
  - Compounding interest, viral spread, forgetting curves.
- **Goal-seeking**
  - System moves toward a target (thermostats, homeostasis).
- **Oscillation**
  - Boom–bust cycles, mood swings, inventory swings (e.g., the Beer Game).
- **Overshoot & collapse**
  - Resource depletion, burnout, unsustainable growth.

#### 7.3 How Feedback and Delays Generate Patterns

- Narratives:
  - **Beer distribution game** – delays and limited visibility cause oscillations and overreactions.{index=32}  
  - Project management: delays in hiring/training create cycles of overwork and quality issues.
- Key lesson: many “crazy” behaviors come from **sane people in poorly designed feedback structures**.

#### 7.4 From Mental Models to Formal Models

- Why build formal models?
  - To test assumptions,
  - To explore “what if” scenarios safely,
  - To communicate structures and trade-offs clearly.
- System dynamics software (Vensim, Stella, iThink, etc.) can translate diagrams into simulations, but the core is still the **system story**.  
- Bridge to **Model Thinking**:
  - Models are explicit, testable versions of our implicit systems narratives.

### Readings

- **Core**
  - John Sterman – *Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World* (intro + chapters on dynamic behaviors).
- **More resources**
  - Short online intros to system dynamics and Beer Game videos (e.g., material from the System Dynamics Society / MIT).
  - Barry Richmond – *An Introduction to Systems Thinking with STELLA* (conceptual sections).

## 8. Complex Systems

### Goals

- Introduce **complexity**: highly interconnected, adaptive, and emergent systems.
- Contrast **complicated** vs **complex**.
- Give language for emergent phenomena learners already experience.

### Subsections

#### 8.1 Complicated vs. Complex

- **Complicated**:
  - Many parts, but predictable if you understand them (jet engine).
- **Complex**:
  - Many interacting agents, learning and adapting (ecosystems, cities, online platforms).
- Complex systems often exhibit:
  - Emergence,
  - Path dependence,
  - Unintended consequences.

#### 8.2 Emergence and Self-Organization

- Simple rules → rich patterns:
  - Flocking birds, traffic jams, market prices.
- Visualization examples:
  - Cellular automata, “Game of Life” as concept story.

#### 8.3 Adaptation and Coevolution

- Agents learn and change strategies:
  - Markets, tech ecosystems, social media.
- Coevolution:
  - Products, regulations, user behavior change together.
- “You are changing the game as you play it.”

#### 8.4 Networks and Cascades

- Basic network concepts:
  - Nodes, links, hubs, clustering.
- Cascades:
  - Epidemics, information spread, bank runs, viral trends.
- Structural properties (e.g., hubs) can make systems robust or fragile.

#### 8.5 Limits of Prediction, Role of Heuristics

- In complex systems:
  - Detailed prediction is often impossible.
  - Scenario thinking, stress testing, and **robustness** matter more than forecasts.
- Ties back to critical thinking:
  - Embrace uncertainty,
  - Use models as **probes** rather than crystal balls.

### Readings

  - Melanie Mitchell – *Complexity: A Guided Tour*. 
- **More resources**
  - Santa Fe Institute – *Introduction to Complexity* (free online course).
  - John H. Holland – *Hidden Order: How Adaptation Builds Complexity*.

## 9. Systems Engineering

### Goals

- Show how systems thinking becomes a **disciplined engineering practice**.
- Provide conceptual literacy for terms like “requirements,” “interfaces,” and “lifecycle.”
- Emphasize socio-technical systems.

### Subsections

#### 9.1 What is Systems Engineering?

- Coordinating many interacting subsystems to achieve a mission:
  - Spacecraft, large software systems, transportation, infrastructure.
- Emphasis on:
  - Requirements, interfaces, verification/validation, lifecycle, risk.

#### 9.2 Lifecycle Thinking

- Concept → design → implementation → operation → decommissioning.
- Feedback from later phases informs earlier ones:
  - Post-mortems → better requirements next time.

#### 9.3 Trade-offs and Constraints

- Classic trade space: performance vs. cost vs. reliability vs. usability vs. schedule.
- Systems engineering as structured negotiation of trade-offs.

#### 9.4 Socio-Technical Systems

- Systems include:
  - People, processes, technology, and environment.
- Ignoring the human component (training, incentives, culture) undermines technical design.

#### 9.5 Systems Engineering as Structured Critical Thinking

- Documented assumptions and traceability:
  - “Where did this requirement come from?”
- Early identification and mitigation of risks.
- Strong overlap with disciplined critical thinking.

### Readings

- **Core**
  - INCOSE – *Systems Engineering Handbook* (overview chapters on life cycle and concepts).
  - NASA – *NASA Systems Engineering Handbook* (intro + fundamentals + life cycle overview).
- **More resources**
  - Case-study style readings on successful/failed large systems (e.g., space missions, large software projects) analyzed from a systems engineering perspective.

## 10. Integrating the Systems Lens (Bridge to Model Thinking)

### Goals

- Pull everything together into a **practical mental toolkit**.
- Make a smooth handoff from “systems thinking” to “model thinking.”
- Emphasize habits more than terminology.

### Subsections

#### 10.1 Checklist: Thinking in Systems in Everyday Decisions

When facing a problem, learners can ask:

- What is the **behavior over time** I’m seeing?  
- What are the key **stocks** and **flows**?  
- What **feedback loops** might be at work (reinforcing or balancing)?  
- Where are the **delays**?  
- Am I dealing with a **known archetype**?  
- What **boundary** am I drawing – what am I leaving out?  
- Where might **leverage points** be?  
- Is this system **complex** (adaptive, emergent) or just complicated?

#### 10.2 Connecting Systems Thinking and Model Thinking

- **Systems thinking**:
  - Mental stories and qualitative diagrams (CLDs, BOTGs, archetypes).
- **Model thinking**:
  - Choosing formal representations (equations, simulations, agent-based models, etc.).
- Key message: **good modeling starts with a clear systems story**.

#### 10.3 Common Pitfalls & Meta-Critical Thinking

- Treating a diagram or model as reality.
- Using archetypes as labels rather than hypotheses.
- Overconfidence in elegant models in messy worlds.
- Neglecting power, values, and ethics in system design and interventions.

#### 10.4 Practice Project / Capstone (if used as a course)

- Learners choose a real-world issue (personal, organizational, societal).
- Tasks:
  - Frame it as a system (define stocks, flows, boundaries, goals).
  - Draw a simple CLD and BOTGs.
  - Identify possible archetypes.
  - Propose leverage points and design changes.
  - (Optional) Sketch how one might formalize this in a model (preparing for the next **Model Thinking** unit).

### Readings

- **Core**
  - Donella H. Meadows – revisit key chapters of *Thinking in Systems* as synthesis.  
  - Melanie Mitchell – revisit key chapters of *Complexity: A Guided Tour* (on emergence and limits of prediction).
- **More resources**
  - Peter Senge – *The Fifth Discipline* (for integration of systems thinking with organizational learning and mental models).

---

## Optional Extra Sections / Sidebars

These can be short sidebars or mini-sections rather than full chapters.

### A. Mental Models and Systems

- All diagrams, stories, and models are **mental models** of reality, not reality itself.
- Systems thinking helps:
  - Make mental models explicit,
  - Test and revise them.
- Perfect bridge to your **Model Thinking** unit:
  - Models as tools, not truths.

### B. Resilience vs. Efficiency

- Efficient systems often have little slack and can be **brittle**.
- Resilient systems:
  - Have buffers, redundancy, and diversity.
  - Can absorb shocks and adapt.
- Great tie-in to:
  - Risk, robustness,
  - Scenario thinking and long-term critical thinking.
