## Curriculum

## 1) What Is a Causal Claim?

**Purpose.** Give readers a shared vocabulary and a feel for what makes a statement causal vs. merely descriptive or correlational.

**Core ideas.**

* Causation as **difference-making**: “If X hadn’t happened, Y wouldn’t have.”
* **Kinds of causes**: necessary, sufficient, contributory; single vs. multiple causation; mechanisms vs. regularities.
* Classic **heuristics**: Mill’s Methods (agreement, difference, residues, concomitant variation).
* **Counterfactuals** (what-if worlds) as an intuitive lens.
* How causal claims show up in everyday writing: news, policy memos, product claims, health advice.

**Simple tools & practice.**

* “Is it causal?” checklist: verb test (causes/leads to), counterfactual test, ruled-out-alternatives test.
* Short paragraph rewrites: convert correlation headlines into cautious causal versions (and vice-versa).

**Feeds forward.** Sets the vocabulary you’ll reuse when talking about risks, biases (e.g., “post hoc”), and model/systems thinking.

**Resources (plain text).**

* John Stuart Mill, “A System of Logic,” Book III (1843).
* James Woodward, “Making Things Happen: A Theory of Causal Explanation” (2003).
* Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie, “The Book of Why” (2018).
* Nancy Cartwright, “Nature’s Capacities and Their Measurement” (1989).
* Christopher Hitchcock (ed.), “The Oxford Handbook of Causation” (2009), selected chapters.
* Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, “Causation” and “Counterfactual Theories of Causation,” latest editions.

## 2) How Do We Learn About Causes?

**Purpose.** Demystify study designs and the idea of **identification**—how a design, not a formula, lets us argue that X → Y.

**Core ideas.**

* **Experiments**: randomization, control, blinding; why random assignment breaks confounding.
* **When experiments aren’t possible**: ethics, feasibility, cost.
* **Quasi-/natural experiments**: policy changes, lotteries, shocks; what makes them credible.
* The **identification vs. estimation** distinction (the “can we claim causation?” step precedes “how big is it?”).
* **External validity**: will it travel? Mechanisms and context.

**Simple tools & practice.**

* Study-design spotter: classify a summarized paper/headline as RCT, natural experiment, before/after, or cross-sectional.
* The “threats to validity” mini-audit: confounding, selection, reverse causation, measurement error.

**Feeds forward.** Prepares readers to parse risk studies and to spot bias and overclaiming.

**Resources (plain text).**

* William R. Shadish, Thomas D. Cook, and Donald T. Campbell, “Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Generalized Causal Inference” (2002).
* Donald T. Campbell and Julian C. Stanley, “Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Research” (1966).

## 3) Reasoning with Causal Diagrams and Evidence

**Purpose.** Teach everyday readers to use simple **DAGs** (causal maps) to reason about confounding and bias—graphically, not algebraically.

**Core ideas.**

* Nodes and arrows: how to sketch a story of cause → effect.
* **Confounders, mediators, colliders** (and why “adjusting” a collider backfires).
* Why “more control variables” is **not** always better.
* **Simpson’s paradox** and stratification in plain language.
* **Triangulation**: combine different designs, data sources, and theories.

**Simple tools & practice.**

* Five-minute DAGs: draw a tiny graph for a headline claim; ask “what must be blocked?”
* “Adjust or don’t adjust?” flashcards: confounder vs. mediator vs. collider examples.

**Feeds forward.** Gives visual habits that help with risk communication (what’s adjusted?), bias (where did it creep in?), and systems thinking (feedback loops vs. DAG acyclicity).

**Resources (plain text).**

* Judea Pearl, Madelyn Glymour, and Nicholas P. Jewell, “Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer” (2016), Chapters 1–3.
* Stephen L. Morgan and Christopher Winship, “Counterfactuals and Causal Inference” (2nd ed., 2015), conceptual chapters.

## 4) Interdisciplinary Extensions

**Purpose.** Show how different disciplines **operationalize** causality so readers can evaluate claims across domains.

**A. Epidemiology & Public Health**

* **Bradford Hill considerations** (plural!): strength, consistency, temporality, dose-response, plausibility, coherence, experiment, analogy, specificity (with caveats).
* **General vs. specific causation** (population evidence vs. “did it cause this person’s harm?”).
* **Absolute vs. relative risk** (bridges to next unit).

**Key resources (plain text).**

* A. Bradford Hill, “The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation?” (1965).
* Kenneth J. Rothman, Sander Greenland, and Timothy L. Lash, “Modern Epidemiology” (3rd ed., 2008), selected conceptual sections.

* M. Susser, “Causal Thinking in the Health Sciences” (1973).

**B. Economics & Social Science**

* **Natural experiments** and the “credibility revolution.”
* High-level ideas: **instrumental variables** (encouragement devices), **difference-in-differences** (before/after with a comparison), **regression discontinuity** (thresholds).
* Emphasis on assumptions and falsification tests (placebos, balance checks, pre-trends).

**Key resources (plain text).**

* Joshua D. Angrist and Jörn-Steffen Pischke, “Mastering ’Metrics” (2014).
* Scott Cunningham, “Causal Inference: The Mixtape” (2021), narrative chapters.

**C. Law & Causation (Torts and Evidence)**

* **Factual cause**: the “but-for” test; **multiple sufficient causes**; **material contribution**.
* **Proximate cause**: foreseeability, scope of risk, policy limits; the Palsgraf intuition.
* Standards of proof and expert evidence: **preponderance of the evidence** (civil), **Daubert** reliability factors, role of **epidemiological evidence** in toxic torts.

**Key resources (plain text).**

## 5) Mechanisms, Cases, and Explanations

**Purpose.** Balance statistical claims with **mechanism-based** and **case-based** reasoning so readers can judge plausibility and transfer.

**Core ideas.**

* **Mechanisms**: how X brings about Y; when mechanism knowledge matters for transportability.
* **Process tracing**: using within-case evidence (clues) to test rival causal stories.
* **Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA)**: conjunctive causation and multiple pathways (“causal recipes”).
* **Consilience**: when many weak strands make a strong rope.

**Simple tools & practice.**

* Mechanism map: narrate the steps linking X → Y; list where the chain could break.
* Process-tracing “hoop” vs. “smoking gun” tests—applied to a historical example.
* Mini-QCA with 3–4 binary conditions to show multiple sufficient causes.

**Feeds forward.** Mechanisms tie into systems thinking (feedback, delays) and help with external validity and model choice.

**Resources (plain text).**

* Peter Hedström and Petri Ylikoski, “Causal Mechanisms in the Social Sciences” (2010).
* Alexander L. George and Andrew Bennett, “Case Studies and Theory Development in the Social Sciences” (2005).

## 6) Judging, Communicating, and Using Causal Claims

**Purpose.** Turn the toolkit into habits: how to read, communicate, and apply causal claims responsibly.

**Core ideas.**

* **Effect size vs. importance**; absolute vs. relative change; heterogeneity of effects.
* **Uncertainty** in plain language: intervals as ranges of reasonable values; robustness checks over ritual p-values.
* **Common pitfalls**: post hoc ergo propter hoc, base-rate neglect, regression to the mean, selection bias, p-hacking, garden-of-forking-paths.
* **Communication**: honest headlines; what to include in a one-paragraph causal summary (design, assumptions, magnitude, uncertainty, transportability).

**Simple tools & practice.**

* The **Causal Claim Skeptic’s Checklist**:

  1. What is the causal question? 2) What design identifies it? 3) What assumptions must hold? 4) What rival explanations remain? 5) How big is the effect (on an absolute scale)? 6) How uncertain is it? 7) Will it generalize?
* Rewrite exercises: improve an exaggerated claim; add context on assumptions and uncertainty.

**Feeds forward.** This section hands off directly to **Risk Analysis** (absolute risk, expected harm), **Cognitive Bias** (how our minds mangle causal evidence), **Analytical/Model Thinking** (choosing representations), and **Systems Thinking** (feedback and nonlinearity).

**Resources (plain text).**

* David Spiegelhalter, “The Art of Statistics” (2019), communication chapters.
* American Statistical Association, “Statement on p-Values” (2016), lay summaries.
* Gerd Gigerenzer, “Calculated Risks” (2002).

# Teaching Moves 

* **One-page “design cards.”** Reusable reference cards for RCT, natural experiment, DiD, IV, RD, plus a law card (but-for vs. proximate cause) and an epi card (Hill’s considerations).
* **Micro-DAGs in the margin.** Every time a claim appears, give a three-node sketch and a one-line “what must be blocked?” note.
* **“Two plausible stories” boxes.** For any correlation, show two rival DAGs/stories and what evidence would separate them.
* **Case vignettes** from different fields (a vaccine trial, a minimum-wage study, a toxic tort lawsuit, an algorithmic fairness audit).
* **Bridges** to later units:

  * Risk analysis: convert relative risks into **expected harms/benefits**.
  * Cognitive bias: how confirmation bias and motivated reasoning distort causal reading.
  * Model thinking: when to prefer DAGs, state-space models, agent-based stories.
  * Systems thinking: loop diagrams vs. acyclic DAGs; when feedback breaks simple causal claims.

---

# Assessment Ideas (lightweight, book-friendly)

* **Headline autopsy.** Given 5 claims, identify: causal or not? If causal, what design could justify it; what assumptions?
* **Design choice scenarios.** Pick between RCT, natural experiment, DiD, or case study given constraints; defend the choice.
* **Law lab.** Short facts in a hypothetical tort case—decide factual and proximate cause; state the standard of proof and what scientific evidence would help.
* **Mechanism memo.** Write a 150-word mechanism explanation with one weak link flagged for further evidence.
* **Triangulation plan.** For a policy question, outline two complementary lines of evidence (e.g., a natural experiment and process tracing).
