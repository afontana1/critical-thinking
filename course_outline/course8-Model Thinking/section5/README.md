# Section 5: Models of People: Thinking Electrons

In this section, we study various ways that social scientists model people. We study and contrast three different models. The rational actor approach, behavioral models , and rule based models . These lectures provide context for many of the models that follow. There's no specific reading for these lectures though I mention several books on behavioral economics that you may want to consider. Also, if you find the race to the bottom game interesting just type "Rosemary Nagel Race to the Bottom" into a search engine and you'll get several good links. You can also find good introductions to "Zero Intelligence Traders" by typing that in as well.

Here is a link to a brief primer on behavioral economics that has more references.
