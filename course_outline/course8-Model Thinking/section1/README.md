# Section 1: Introduction: Why Model?

In these lectures, I describe some of the reasons why a person would want to take a modeling course. These reasons fall into four broad categories:

1. To be an intelligent citizen of the world

2. To be a clearer thinker

3. To understand and use data

4. To better decide, strategize, and design

There are two readings for this section. These should be read either after the first video or at the completion of all of the videos.
