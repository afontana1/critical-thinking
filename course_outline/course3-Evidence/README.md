# Course Overview: Evidence & Proof

**Big question:**
What *is* evidence, how does it support claims and decisions in law, science, and everyday life, and how should we *reason with it* responsibly?

## By the end, students should be able to:

* Distinguish **evidence**, **data**, **reasons**, and **arguments** (and see how they interact).
* Explain major **theories of evidence** in epistemology (e.g., evidence as experiences vs. propositions vs. knowledge; Haack’s “foundherentism”). ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][1])
* Describe and evaluate different **types of evidence**: testimonial, documentary, physical/trace, statistical, anecdotal, negative/missing, higher-order.
* Understand core **legal concepts**: admissibility, burdens of production and persuasion, standards of proof, and the role of **narratives** in legal fact-finding. ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][2])
* Use **story-based** and **Bayesian** tools (likelihoods, Bayes factors, inference networks) to analyze evidential support at a conceptual level. ([PhilPapers][3])
* Critically assess **evidence-based policy/practice**, hierarchies of evidence, and the epistemic challenges of forensic and statistical evidence (e.g., DNA, expert testimony). ([RSS][4])
* Diagnose and avoid **evidential pathologies**: cherry-picking, confirmation bias, survivorship bias, overreliance on anecdote, “delusive exactness.”
* Reflect on **burdens of proof** and **higher-order evidence** (evidence about your own reliability, bias, or evidential situation). ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][5])

# Unit 1 – What Evidence Is

**Guiding questions**

* What *counts* as evidence, and for what?
* How is evidence related to *justification*, *knowledge*, and *truth*?
* Why do epistemologists, lawyers, and scientists define evidence differently?

### Sub-units

1. **Everyday vs. technical concepts of evidence**

   * Contrast everyday talk (“Do you have any evidence?”) with:

     * Epistemological concepts (evidence as what justifies belief). ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][1])
     * Legal concepts (evidence as what can be used to prove a fact in court). ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][2])
   * Bring back the **assertion–reason–argument** distinction from Argumentation Fundamentals.

2. **Theories of evidence in epistemology**

   * SEP & IEP on evidence: evidence as propositions, experiences, or knowledge; internalist vs. externalist accounts. ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][1])
   * **Susan Haack’s foundherentism**: the crossword-puzzle model of evidential support; against pure foundationalism and pure coherentism. ([Miami Law Repository][6])
   * How these theories affect what we treat as *good enough* evidence in practice.

3. **Evidence, justification, and belief revision**

   * **Belief revision**: how new evidence should rationally change our beliefs (very light intro, linking to Bayesian confirmation later).
   * **Justification vs. truth**: justified beliefs can be false; evidence can mislead.
   * **Doubt** and **skepticism**: when should we suspend judgment?

4. **Varieties of evidence & the “variety-of-evidence thesis”**

   * Intro to the idea that *diverse* and *independent* evidence can be more confirmatory than repeated similar evidence.
   * Osimani & Landes, *Varieties of Error and Varieties of Evidence in Scientific Inference* (philosophy of science treatment). ([PhilSci Archive][7])
   * How this connects to triangulation, robustness, and mixed methods.

**Core readings**

* SEP: **“Evidence”**. ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][1])
* IEP: **“Evidence”** (for a compact overview). ([Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy][8])
* Susan Haack, *Evidence and Inquiry: A Pragmatist Reconstruction of Epistemology* (selections on evidence & foundherentism). ([Miami Law Repository][6])
* Barbara Osimani & Jürgen Landes, “Varieties of Error and Varieties of Evidence in Scientific Inference.” ([PhilSci Archive][7])

You can also sprinkle in short SEP/IEP entries on **Justification**, **Belief Revision**, and **Skepticism** as needed.

# Unit 2 – Types and Sources of Evidence

**Guiding questions**

* What *kinds* of things can be evidence (testimony, documents, traces, statistics, anecdotes, absences…)?
* How do law and science classify evidence?
* How do reliability, admissibility, and *context* change what we count as usable evidence?

### Sub-units

1. **Legal typologies of evidence**

   * **Testimonial**, **documentary**, **real/physical**, and **demonstrative** evidence (maps, models, diagrams). ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][2])
   * Key legal notions:

     * **Admissible vs. inadmissible evidence**
     * **Hearsay**, **character evidence**, **expert evidence**, **circumstantial vs. direct** evidence.
   * U.S. **Federal Rules of Evidence** as a concrete legal framework (relevance, prejudice vs. probative value, expert testimony standards).

2. **Testimony, memory, and narrative evidence**

   * **Eyewitness testimony** as a paradigmatic source of evidence (and error).
   * Psychological work on **memory**, **priming**, suggestibility, and confidence vs. accuracy.
   * **Narrative testimony** and its evaluation:

     * Coherence vs. accuracy.
     * “Anchored narratives” in legal theory (Allen et al.) – stories anchored in evidence rather than free-floating.

3. **Documentary, digital, and trace evidence**

   * **Documentary evidence**: records, emails, CCTV, digital logs.
   * **Trace evidence**: fingerprints, fibers, biological traces; chain of custody and contamination.
   * Forensic science as a field where **measurement, interpretation, and institutional practices** all matter.

4. **Statistical, anecdotal, and negative evidence**

   * **Statistical evidence** vs. **anecdotal evidence**; when anecdotes are informative and when they mislead.
   * **Negative evidence**:

     * Evidence of absence vs. absence of evidence (with LessWrong-style discussion).
     * Arguments from silence, expected vs. unexpected absences.
   * **Hierarchies of evidence** in medicine and policy (RCTs, observational studies, case reports) and why they’re controversial. ([RSS][4])

5. **Evidence-based practice and policy**

   * “Evidence-based medicine,” “evidence-based policy,” and “evidence-based management” as movements.
   * **Barbara Osimani** and others on whether standard hierarchies overweight RCTs and underweight mechanistic / observational evidence. ([journals.uchicago.edu][9])

**Core readings**

* SEP: **“The Legal Concept of Evidence.”** ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][2])
* Federal Rules of Evidence (Cornell LII or similar online text).
* David Schum, *The Evidential Foundations of Probabilistic Reasoning* (ch. on types/properties of evidence). ([PhilPapers][3])
* William Twining, *Rethinking Evidence* (chapters on legal categories and the “middle ground”).
* Royal Statistical Society, **Guide 1: Fundamentals of probability and statistical evidence in criminal proceedings** (for an accessible typology of statistical/forensic evidence). ([RSS][4])

Plus your existing links to **documentary evidence, trace evidence, hearsay, character evidence, admissible evidence, anecdotal evidence, evidence of absence, survivorship bias**, etc.

# Unit 3 – Reasoning with Evidence: Stories, Schemes, and Bayes

**Guiding questions**

* How do we move from *bits of evidence* to *conclusions*?
* What are **story-based** vs. **probabilistic** models of evidential reasoning?
* How do Bayes factors, inference networks, and Walton’s schemes fit together?

### Sub-units

1. **Walton’s evidential schemes**

   * Schemes like:

     * **Argument from sign**
     * **Argument from evidence to hypothesis**
     * **Argument from correlation to cause**
   * Each with **critical questions** (alternative explanations, reliability of the sign, etc.).
   * Connection to what students saw in *Argumentation Fundamentals* (abduction, IBE, argument from consequences).

2. **Stories, anchored narratives, and hybrid models**

   * **Story schemes** (Bex & co.): fact-finding as building coherent narratives that explain the evidence.
   * **Anchored narratives** (Allen / Pardo): comparing rival stories, each anchored in evidence and background knowledge.
   * **Hybrid theories**: stories + arguments + probabilities. ([PhilPapers][3])

3. **Bayesian confirmation and Bayes factors (conceptual level)**

   * Evidence as something that changes relative plausibility:

     * Likelihoods: *P(E | H)* vs. *P(E | ¬H)*.
     * **Bayes factor** as a measure of the *weight* of evidence. ([SpringerLink][10])
   * Emphasize *conceptual* understanding; defer detailed computation and controversies to the Data/Stats course.
   * Clarify that Bayesian confirmation is **one model** among others, not the entire story about evidence.

4. **Inference networks, Wigmore charts, and graphical models**

   * **Wigmore charts**: classic legal technique for mapping evidence and its inferential structure. ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][11])
   * Schum’s **inference networks**: representing chains and convergences of evidence; “nodes” as facts/hypotheses. ([PhilPapers][3])
   * Modern **Bayesian networks** in law and forensics (Garbolino, Fenton & Neil) as probabilistic successors.

5. **Pitfalls in evidential reasoning**

   * **Base-rate neglect**, **prosecutor’s fallacy**, and **defense attorney’s fallacy** in interpreting DNA and other statistical evidence.
   * Overfitting stories: making narratives too tight for the actual evidential support.
   * The tension between **narrative coherence** and **probabilistic rigor**.

**Core readings**

* Douglas Walton on argument from evidence / sign (chapters from *Argumentation Schemes for Presumptive Reasoning*).
* Floris Bex, “The Hybrid Theory of Stories and Arguments” and “Story Schemes for Argumentation about the Facts of a Crime.”
* David Schum, *The Evidential Foundations of Probabilistic Reasoning* (sections on inference networks and Wigmore). ([PhilPapers][3])
* J.N. Morey, J.-W. Romeijn & J.N. Rouder, “The philosophy of Bayes factors and the quantification of statistical evidence.” ([SpringerLink][10])
* Paolo Garbolino, “Evaluation of Scientific Evidence Using Bayesian Networks” (plus his later work on Bayes factors and radical probabilism).

# Unit 4 – Burden of Proof, Standards, and Presumption (Revisited)

**Guiding questions**

* Who needs to *prove* what, and to what degree?
* How do legal, scientific, and everyday contexts set **different proof standards**?
* How do **burdens of proof** and **presumptions** interact with evidence?

### Sub-units

1. **Burden of proof in philosophy, law, and everyday discourse**

   * **Philosophical** burden of proof: on the person making the positive claim; link to “Hitchens’ razor” and “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.” ([Wikipedia][12])
   * **Legal** burdens:

     * Burden of **production** vs. **persuasion**.
     * Standards: “some evidence,” “preponderance,” “clear and convincing,” “beyond a reasonable doubt,” etc. ([Wikipedia][13])

2. **Walton on burden of proof and presumption**

   * **Dialogical** view: different types of dialogue (persuasion, negotiation, inquiry) have different burden rules.
   * Presumptions as **defeasible starting points** that shift the burden.
   * Link back to your earlier *Presumption, Presupposition, and Assumption* unit.

3. **Pigliucci & Boudry: the burden of proof game in science vs. pseudoscience**

   * Distinction between **evidential** and **prudential** burdens of proof (error management, stakes). ([PhilArchive][14])
   * How scientific norms allocate burden (e.g., extraordinary claims about homeopathy, ESP).
   * Misuse of burden of proof as a rhetoric move (“You can’t disprove X, so X is reasonable”).

4. **Proof standards across domains**

   * Compare:

     * **Criminal vs. civil** standards in law.
     * **Regulatory standards** (e.g., precautionary principle, FDA-style risk/benefit).
     * **Scientific standards** (replication, peer review, meta-analysis, consensus).
   * How standards depend on **stakes, asymmetries of error, and background knowledge**.

5. **Higher-order evidence and meta-level doubt**

   * **Higher-order evidence** as evidence about your own reliability or evidential situation (e.g., learning that you’re tired, biased, or the study is low-quality). ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][5])
   * How higher-order evidence can *shift* burdens or lower your confidence even when first-order evidence stays fixed.

**Core readings**

* Douglas Walton, *Burden of Proof, Presumption and Argumentation* (Cambridge).
* SEP: **“Burden of Proof (Philosophy)”** and **“Burden of Proof (Law)”** (or the relevant sections in entries you already listed). ([Wikipedia][12])
* Massimo Pigliucci & Maarten Boudry, “Prove it! The Burden of Proof Game in Science vs. Pseudoscience Disputes.” ([PhilArchive][14])
* SEP: **“Higher-Order Evidence.”** ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][5])

Plus your existing cluster on **Ronald J. Allen** (relative plausibility, burdens of proof), **Susan Haack** (evidence and legal proof), and **William Twining** (burdens and standards in legal reasoning).

# Unit 5 – Relevance, Reliability, and Evidential Pathologies

**Guiding questions**

* What does it mean for evidence to be **relevant** or **probative**?
* How do we assess the **reliability** of sources, instruments, and methods?
* How do cognitive and social biases distort our evidential landscape?

### Sub-units

1. **Relevance and probative value**

   * Conceptual distinctions:

     * Logical/probabilistic **relevance** (evidence that *changes* the probability of a hypothesis).
     * Legal relevance (FRE 401: any tendency to make a fact more or less probable).
     * **Probative value** vs. **prejudicial effect**.
   * **Royal Statistical Society** guides:

     * Guide 2: *Assessing the Probative Value of DNA Evidence* (likelihood ratios, avoiding fallacies). ([RSS][4])
     * Guide 3: *The Logic of Forensic Proof* (inferential structures, relevance).

2. **Reliability, validity, and error**

   * **Measurement reliability and validity**: instruments, tests, coding schemas.
   * Forensic science: Mnookin’s work on “junk forensic science” and validation of forensic methods.
   * **Legal responsibility and causation** (Moore, Stapleton): dealing with probabilistic evidence and causal uncertainty.

3. **Cognitive and social distortions of evidence**

   * **Confirmation bias**, **cherry-picking**, **belief perseverance**, **survivorship bias**.
   * How these interact with:

     * Algorithmic feeds (social media).
     * Political and ideological polarization.
   * **Higher-order evidence** about our own bias as part of evidential evaluation.

4. **Disconfirming, negative, and higher-order evidence**

   * **Disconfirming evidence** and Popperian falsification vs. more nuanced Bayesian views.
   * **Evidence of absence** vs. **absence of evidence**; arguments from silence; Walton’s *Arguments from Ignorance*.
   * When lacking expected evidence itself becomes *strong* evidence (e.g., missing records, silence where protest would be expected).

5. **Putting it together: relevance in data-rich environments**

   * How big data / data science changes the **search space** for evidence but doesn’t solve the problem of relevance.
   * Bridge to the next course: we’ll need tools from **statistics and causal modeling** to manage relevance and confounding at scale.

**Core readings**

* Royal Statistical Society, Law Guides 1–4 (probability fundamentals, DNA evidence, logic of forensic proof, case assessment & expert evidence). ([RSS][4])
* Jennifer Mnookin, “Of Black Boxes, Instruments, and Experts: Testing the Validity of Forensic Science” and related work on forensic epistemology.
* Susan Haack, “Proof, Probability, and Statistics: The Problem of ‘Delusive Exactness’.”
* Douglas Walton, *Arguments from Ignorance* (for arguments from silence and negative evidence).
* SEP: **“Higher-Order Evidence”** (again, for the meta-evidential angle). ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][5])

## Possible capstone activities (for the Evidence & Proof section)

You can mirror the style of your Argumentation Fundamentals capstone, but now centered on **evidence**:

1. **Legal–scientific case study**

   * Students choose a real or fictional case involving:

     * Forensic evidence (DNA, fingerprints, digital traces)
     * Conflicting eyewitness testimony
     * Statistical or epidemiological evidence (e.g., drug side effects, environmental risk).
   * Tasks:

     * Build a **Wigmore/Schum-style inference network** or argument map.
     * Classify evidence types (testimonial, trace, statistical, negative).
     * Identify burdens of proof and applicable standards.
     * Analyze relevance and probative value (possibly using simple likelihood ratio/Bayes factor intuitions).
     * Diagnose evidential pathologies (cherry picking, overconfidence in shaky forensics, ignoring higher-order evidence).

2. **Evidence-based policy mini-project**

   * Students pick a policy claim (e.g., “cash bail should be abolished,” “mask mandates are effective,” “AI risk justifies regulation X”) and:

     * Collect **heterogeneous evidence** (RCTs, observational data, case studies, expert testimony, public narratives).
     * Evaluate the **variety and independence** of evidence (using the variety-of-evidence lens).
     * Map **burdens of proof** and **stake-dependent standards** (how strong should evidence be, given the stakes?).
     * Reflect on how **data literacy tools** (the next course) could sharpen their evaluation.
